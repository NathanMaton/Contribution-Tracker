If we are determined to have a day without a traffic accident in all of America, we can have it. <p>So let us see how many highway deaths and injuries we can prevent by obeying traffic regulations, following simple rules of good sportsmanship and courtesy, and staying alert and careful--whether we are driving or walking. <p>Let us establish an unblemished record of safety on Safe Driving Day, and then make that record our standard for the future.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
