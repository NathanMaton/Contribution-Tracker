I believe in protecting the fundamental right of freedom of association, and that private organizations like the Scouts should remain free to organize themselves and set membership rules and requirements as they themselves think are in the best interest of their organization."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
