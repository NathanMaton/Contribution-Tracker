With unemployment stuck over 8 percent for 40 months, we can't afford policies that kill jobs and stifle innovation in one of America's most dynamic industries. The ill-considered medical device tax is only one of many fatal flaws in Obamacare. As president, I will work from my first day in office to dismantle Barack Obama's federal health-care takeover and replace it with real reform that strengthens our health care system and puts patients first."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
