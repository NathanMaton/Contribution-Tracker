Each of them volunteered to serve, knowing we are at war. We owe them deep thanks, unyielding gratitude, and a responsibility to keep the memory of their lives, their virtue, and their valor alive. My thoughts and prayers are with their families and their fellow service members."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
