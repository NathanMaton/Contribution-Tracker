Now the voters of the Northern Mariana Islands—nearly 8,000 miles from Washington, D.C.—have spoken.&nbsp; And what they've said today is that they want to bring change to their beautiful islands by bringing change to our nation's capital.&nbsp; My son Matt told me about his visit to Saipan and the warm reception he received, and I am honored and delighted to have the support of all nine of the CNMI's delegates."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
