I am pleased that we will be increasing our delegate count in a very substantial way after tonight. Ann and I made a lot of new friends in Alabama and Mississippi and we look forward to campaigning in those states in the general election.<p>"I am running for president to create jobs and get this economy moving again. It's past time to get America working again. It's past time to end unemployment that has been stuck over 8 percent for the longest period since the Great Depression.&nbsp; It's past time for our great country to stand tall once again.<p>"With the delegates won tonight, we are even closer to the nomination. Ann and I would like to thank the people of Alabama and Mississippi. Because of their support, our campaign is on the move and ready to take on President Obama in the fall." &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
