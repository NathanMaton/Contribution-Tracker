And what they have said is that they want to send a conservative businessman to the White House. With these two contests, I have gained at least 18 additional delegates on my quest for the Republican Party presidential nomination."<p>"It's time for Republicans to join together and focus on our central challenge, which is defeating Barack Obama at the polls this coming November. The country can't afford four more years of his failed economic policies.&nbsp; It's time to make our federal government simpler, smaller, and smarter.&nbsp; I know the way forward. And I thank all those voters who have shown their confidence in my ability to turn our great country around."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
