The international community should demand that the facts concerning Paya's death be accurately determined and that the surviving witnesses be protected.&nbsp; Ann and I wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Paya family and to Cuba's pro-democracy movement for the loss of Osvaldo Paya, a man of extraordinary courage, conviction, and peace."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
