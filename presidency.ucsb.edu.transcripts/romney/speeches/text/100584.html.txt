Then I realized he probably means he's for all the energy sources above the ground, all right. So he's for solar and wind, which are just fine, but he doesn't like coal, oil, gas because they're below ground. Now we understand 'Obama-speak' a little better. I'm actually for everything that comes from above and everything that comes from below. I want to get energy in this country and become energy secure." &mdash; Mitt Romney<p><b>Remarks</b><p><b>Tunkhannock, PA</b><p><b>April 5, 2012</b><p><b>Mitt Romney: </b>"[President Obama] said the other day, by the way, did you hear that he said that... You know, sometimes you hear what he says but it's such striking contrast with what he does, I mean it's like your head goes around. You know, you just wonder, can he really be saying that? The other day, he said he was for 'all of the above' in the energy world. And I thought: how in the world can he be saying that? Then I realized he probably means he's for all the energy sources above the ground, all right.
