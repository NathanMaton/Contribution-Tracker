The President thinks that it's government that should take responsibility for all the successful businesses in this country. And the truth is, it is not government. Government has a role to play but the people who deserve the credit for starting a business and growing it and hiring people are the entrepreneur who started it and the many people that work at that business." &mdash; Mitt Romney<p><b>"The Dan Maduri Show"<br>820 AM-Tampa</b><br><b>July 19, 2012</b><p align="center"><b><i>Listen To Mitt Romney Discuss President Obama's Economic Philosophy<iframe allowfullscreen="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/h4qSIb2Se4M" frameborder="0" height="380" width="496"></iframe></i></b><p><b>DAN MADURI: </b>"When you look President Obama's recent comments in quotes saying 'if you've got a business, you didn't build that.

Government is not playing the role this president thinks it is. He is completely misguided. It is a foreign concept to think that government is the center of America's economy. It is free people pursuing their dreams."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
