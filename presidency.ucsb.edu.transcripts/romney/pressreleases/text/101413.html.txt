With millions of Americans struggling for work and the economy stuck in yet another summer slump, President Obama has to run a dishonest campaign because he can't get re-elected on the truth." &mdash;Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>This Morning, Obama Campaign Strategist David Axelrod Denied That The Obama Campaign Is Running A Negative Campaign:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Obama Campaign Strategist David Axelrod: "I Think It's A Mistake To Say That Our Advertising Has Somehow Been More Negative." </b>CROWLEY: "The president remains under 50% approval, which isn't a great place as you know for an incumbent. This race has not changed in months despite the fact that both sides and the Obama campaign particularly has been just pouring money into these negative ads &mdash; some 60% of your ads have been negative. Your fundraising is lagging behind Romney's. Why?" AXELROD : "Well, let me just correct one thing you said, Candy. 90% of the ads that have been run by Romney and his allies since March have been negative and named at the president, so i think it's a mistake to say that our advertising has somehow been more negative...." CROWLEY: "No, no I just said that yours has been 60% negative."

KARL: "That's right. Over the past month, Obama's own campaign has run its ads more than 68,000 times, nearly 80% of them attacking Mitt Romney. Negative and loose with the facts. Take this Obama ad. OBAMA AD: 'Romney's never stood up to China. All he's ever done is send them our jobs.' KARL: 'But that's not true.
