Hundreds of job losses threatening a community couldn't get the President's attention, but the prospect for a bad campaign event has the White House scrambling. As president, Mitt Romney will never let politics impact his commitment to getting Americans back to work and keeping our nation safe." &mdash; Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today, The Obama White House Abruptly Revised Course &mdash; Claiming It's "Committed" To Keeping Open An Ohio Base Threatened By President Obama's Defense Cuts:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Today, The White House Claimed President Obama Is "Committed To Working With The Department Of Defense To Find A Mission For Mansfield Lahm Air National Guard Base."</b> " 'That said, the president is committed to working with the Department of Defense to find a mission for Mansfield Lahm Air National Guard Base, so that the men and women who serve there can continue to make their important contribution to our national security,' White House spokeswoman Joanna Rosholm said Tuesday night."

And in Mansfield the local paper is reporting if President Obama has his way his Air Force One arrival would be one of the final flights into the Mansfield airport, because the president wants to do away with the mission for the 800 guardsmen at the Mansfield." WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY: "I'll have to take the question, I'm not aware of that particular issue.

Elimination of the program would leave the 179th Airlift Wing without a flying mission. It could jeopardize the future of the unit, which has 551 part-time and 204 full-time airmen. The Mansfield base has two of its four C-27Js deployed in Afghanistan. It received the planes last summer, and was the first base in the country to deploy to Afghanistan with them."

The Air National Guard base where Air Force One will land remains threatened by Obama's proposed cuts to the military budget. With no replacement mission for the 179th, the cargo planes that served so valiantly in Afghanistan could be scrapped next year. The cost to operate these planes -- and staff the Air National Guard unit -- is far lower than any alternative aircraft operated by our full-time military. We have proven the cost effectiveness of the 179th, yet the president's military budget has proposed eliminating the aircraft and ending the 179th's mission in Mansfield. Beyond the threat to national security, Mansfield stands to lose nearly 1,000 jobs if the president gets his way."
