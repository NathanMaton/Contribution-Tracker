Instead, Obamacare has delivered skyrocketing costs, failed programs, millions of Americans struggling to obtain insurance, and $716 billion in Medicare cuts that will impact today's seniors. As president, Mitt Romney will immediately repeal this disastrous law and replace it with reforms that empower individuals and free job creators from Obamacare's burdens." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Confusing Language In Obamacare Has Jeopardized The Availability Of Insurance Coverage For Millions Of Americans:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"Confusing Language" In Obamacare Has Jeopardized Insurance Coverage For "Millions Of Americans Living On Modest Incomes." </b>"Confusing language in the health care reform law has raised the possibility that millions of Americans living on modest incomes may be unable to afford their employers' family policies and yet fail to qualify for government subsidies to buy their own insurance. ... The people left in the lurch would be those who had lower incomes but were not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. They would either have to pay more than they could afford for an employer's family plan or go without health insurance."

This estimated percentage would continue to increase, reaching roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent by 2050. In practice, providers could not sustain continuing negative margins and, absent legislative changes, would have to withdraw from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, merge with other provider groups, or shift substantial portions of Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers."&nbsp;("Projected Expenditures Under An Illustrative Scenario With Alternative Payment Updates To Medicare Providers," Center For Medicare & Medicaid Services, 5/13/11) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>52 Percent Of Doctors Say Obamacare Will Compel Them To Close Or Significantly Restrict Their Practices To Medicare Patients.</b> (Merritt Hawkins, "Health Reform and the Decline of Physician Private Practice," The Physicians Foundation, October 2010) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><a href="http://FactCheck.org">FactCheck.org</a>: "The Promise That 'Benefits Will Remain The Same' Is Just As Fictional As The Town Of Mayberry..."</b> "Currently, about 1 in every 4 Medicare beneficiary is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.
