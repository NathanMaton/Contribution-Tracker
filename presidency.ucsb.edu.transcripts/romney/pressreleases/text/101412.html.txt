   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama is at it again today with another dishonest attack meant to distract from his own record of failure. After spending three years pushing policies that drive jobs overseas and sending taxpayer money to foreign-owned companies, it's clear President Obama doesn't have a clue when it comes to job creation in America. Our corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrial world and impairs the ability of American businesses to both compete globally and create jobs here at home. Mitt Romney has a comprehensive plan to reform the corporate tax code that will lower rates, get rid of incentives for firms to create jobs in other countries, and encourage the kind of economic growth President Obama has been unable to deliver." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today, President Obama Plans To Launch Another False Attack On Governor Romney's Tax Plan:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Will Claim Governor Romney's Tax Plan Will Encourage Foreign Job Growth. </b>"White House aides said Obama will cite news reports suggesting that Romney's plans for limited taxing of overseas profits by U.S. companies would encourage foreign job growth. The two candidates have repeatedly accused each other of outsourcing American jobs." (Charles Babington, "Obama To Tout Auto Bailout, Tax Policies In Ohio," <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/obama-tout-auto-bailout-tax-policies-ohio-074000191.html" target="_blank"><i>The Associated Press</i></a>, 7/16/12)<h4><b>But President Obama's Attack Misrepresents Governor Romney's Plan To Implement Pro-Growth Tax Reforms:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Report Cited By The Obama Campaign Erroneously Assumes Corporate Tax Rates Will Remain At Their Current Rates. </b>"The analysis assumes that the U.S. effective tax rate is 27.1%, and it considers only the difference between tax responses under territorial and non-territorial systems. If the U.S. effective tax rate were to fall due to changes in the tax code, the calculated job responses would be lower." (Kimberly A. Clausing, "A Challenging Time For International Tax Policy," Tax Notes, 7/16/12)<ul><li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>FACT CHECK:</b> <b>Governor Romney's Tax Plan Will Overhaul The Tax Code And Cut Corporate Rates To 25 Percent. </b>"Republicans and Democrats agree that the tax code needs work. It has not been thoroughly overhauled in 25 years. ... Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has said he wants to cut the corporate rate to 25 percent." (Patrick Temple, "U.S. Corporate Tax Rate To Be Highest In The Developed World," <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/30/us-corporate-tax-rate_n_1392310.html" target="_blank"><i>Reuters</i></a>, 3/30/12)</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Report Cited By The Obama Campaign Explicitly States That The Current System For International Taxation "Is Broken." </b>"By any measure, the U.S. system of taxing multinational corporations is broken. Because corporations can postpone paying U.S. taxes on foreign profits indefinitely as long as they keep those profits abroad, the current system encourages firms to move factories and jobs to low-tax destinations and to keep their profits reinvested abroad." (Kimberly A. Clausing, "A Challenging Time For International Tax Policy," Tax Notes, 7/16/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama's Own Jobs Council Proposed Moving To A Territorial Tax System "In Order To Make America More Competitive In Global Markets" Rather Than Taxing Foreign Profits.</b> "Many Council members agree that the U.S. should shift to a territorial system of taxation in order to make America more competitive in global markets. While most other developed nations have adopted territorial systems that exempt most or all foreign income from taxes when they are repatriated, the U.S. subjects all worldwide earnings to the corporate income tax when they are brought home to the U.S. This approach actually encourages U.S. companies to keep their earnings abroad rather than investing them here at home. Adopting a territorial tax system would bring us in line with our trading partners and would eliminate the so-called 'lock-out' effect in the current worldwide system of taxation that discourages repatriation and investment of the foreign earnings of American companies in the U.S." ("Reform The Outdated Tax System To Enhance American Competitiveness," <a href="http://www.jobs-council.com/recommendations/reform-the-outdated-tax-system-to-enhance-american-competitiveness/" target="_blank">The Jobs Council</a>, Accessed 2/22/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama's Own Fiscal Commission Recommended A Territorial Tax System Where Most Or All Foreign Profits Are Not Taxed.</b> "Move to a competitive territorial tax system. To bring the U.S. system more in line with our international trading partners', we recommend changing the way we tax foreign-source income by moving to a territorial system. Under such a system, income earned by foreign subsidiaries and branch operations (e.g., a foreign-owned company with a subsidiary operating in the United States) is exempt from their country's domestic corporate income tax. Therefore, under a territorial system, most or all of the foreign profits are not subject to domestic tax. The taxation of passive foreign-source income would not change."

We want to reduce that by over 20%. We want to drop the rate, particularly, for high-tech manufacturers like you, Mr. President, even further than the 20%,' Vice President Joe Biden said at a manufacturing plant in Davenport, Iowa this week. 'We want to create (what's called) a global minimum tax, because American taxpayers shouldn't be providing a larger subsidy for investing abroad than investing at home,' Biden said at a campaign event."

Romney says he would declare a China a currency manipulator on his first day in office."
