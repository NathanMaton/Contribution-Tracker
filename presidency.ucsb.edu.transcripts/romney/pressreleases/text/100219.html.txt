"President Obama has grown government at the expense of the private sector. I will shrink government and expand the private sector with the help of these leaders."<p>Announcing his support, State Representative Blaine Galliher said, "Mitt Romney's plan for more jobs, smaller government, and less debt is exactly what conservatives are looking for in Alabama. After three years of exploding debt and fewer jobs, it is clear that we need a proven job creator and budget cutter like Mitt Romney in the White House. We are supporting Mitt Romney because our country can't afford four more years of President Obama and because Alabama deserves a proven leader like Mitt Romney as president."<p><b>Alabama Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>House Majority Leader Micky Hammon<p>State Representative Blaine Galliher, Chairman of the House Rules Committee<p>State Representative David Sessions<p>State Representative Mike Hill<p>State Representative Richard Baughn<p>State Representative Harry Shiver<p>State Representative Mike Millican<p>State Representative Mike Ball<p>Randy McKinney, AL State Board of Education, District 1<p>George Williams, Alabama Republican Party Senior Vice Chairman<p>Darius Foster, Chairman of the Alabama Minority GOP<p>Greg Albritton<p><b>Previous Alabama Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Former Governor Bob Riley<p>Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard<p>Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey<p>Lee Styslinger III<p>Congressman Mike Rogers<p>Former Congressman Jack Edwards<p>State Senator Cam Ward, Co-Chair of the Alabama Legislative Steering Committee<p>State Representative Phil Williams<p>State Representative Lesley Vance<p>State Representative Steve Hurst<p>State Representative Randy Wood<p>Ambassador Bill Cabaniss<p>Mary Scott Hunter, Alabama State Board of Education<p>Richard Bollinger, Councilman, Montgomery, AL<p>Jeff Peacock, Alabama Republican Party Vice Chair, Districts 1, 2<p>Sue Neuwien, Alabama Republican Party District 2 Chair<p>Marty Connors, Former Alabama Republican Party Chairman</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
