   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"We've heard about the so-called Buffett rule, but what about the Obama rule? The Obama rule says that we must tax American families and small businesses so that government can grow. President Obama has made it clear that raising taxes is the one campaign promise he will keep. Mitt Romney wants to lower the tax rate so that more Americans can keep their hard-earned money and small businesses can begin to grow and hire. American families and small businesses have already suffered enough under the Obama rule." &mdash;Gail Gitcho, Romney Campaign Communications Director<h4><b>Today, President Obama Will Deliver Remarks On The Latest Step In The Obama Rule, Which Emphasizes Tax Increases To Finance The Growth Of Government:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Will Deliver Remarks On The So-Called "Buffett Rule" In Florida To Help Raise Even More Money To Pay For His Federal Spending. </b>"On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will make the case for the proposal at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in the latest of his string of visits to a state that is a prime battleground for the election. While in Florida Mr. Obama will hold three fund-raisers, in Palm Beach, Hollywood and Golden Beach. He will be back in Florida on Friday, in Tampa, before heading to a summit meeting in Colombia."

And that basic principle of fairness, if applied to our tax code, could raise enough money that not only do we pay for our jobs bill, but we also stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade. And as I said when I made the announcement, this is not politics; this is math."

That would raise the highest individual income tax rate to about 42%, including deduction phaseouts, from 35% today. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation found in 2009 that $437 billion of business income would be taxed at higher tax rates under the Obama plan. And since some 4.5 million small-business owners file their annual tax returns as subchapter S firms under the individual tax code, this tax increase would often apply to the same people who Mr. Obama is targeting with his new tax credits."
