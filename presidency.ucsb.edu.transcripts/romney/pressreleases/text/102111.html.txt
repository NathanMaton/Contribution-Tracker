And then the sequestration cuts that the White House came up with, that's the idea of see sequestration, they came up with it according to a book that just came out from Bob Woodward. It was their idea. So, we're talking about $1 trillion in cuts. The estimates of the kind of numbers of jobs lost in Virginia from these cuts is between 100,000 and 200,000. It's unthinkable. It's unthinkable to Virginia, to our employment needs, but it's also unthinkable to the ability and the commitment of America to maintain our liberty, with liberty for all.&nbsp; And, therefore, if I'm President of the United States, we'll get rid of those sequestration cuts and rebuild America's military might."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
