Now, we need to answer to their unique needs. As they return from the battlefield, they shouldn't have to join unemployment lines or worry about keeping a roof over their heads. Unfortunately, the economy under Barack Obama has stalled. We need a leader who will turn it around and look out for the best interests of those who risked all to defend our freedom and way of life."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
