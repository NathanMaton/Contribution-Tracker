"Congressman Fitzpatrick shares my vision of cutting spending and getting Washington out of the way of the private sector. With his help and the hard work of those supporting me in Pennsylvania, we can defeat President Obama and turn around the country."<p>"It is time for Republicans to unite behind the one candidate who can defeat President Obama and end the failed policies of the last three years," said Congressman Fitzpatrick. "Like many of my colleagues, I know Senator Santorum and respect the work he did for Pennsylvania but I am strongly supporting Mitt Romney. Pennsylvania and the rest of the country can't afford four more years of President Obama's failed policies and it is important that we nominate a proven conservative like Mitt Romney to face President Obama. I urge my fellow Pennsylvanians to support Mitt Romney and look forward to working with him in the weeks before the primary and to defeat President Obama in November."<p><b>Background on Congressman Fitzpatrick:</b><p>Congressman Fitzpatrick represents Pennsylvania's 8th district.&nbsp; Congressman Fitzpatrick served from 2005 to 2007 and returned to Congress in 2011.
