   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Symbol of Failure." Two years ago, President Obama went to Solyndra and touted it as an example of his initiative to create jobs. Today, the company is bankrupt and the building stands empty as a symbol of the failure of President Obama's policies.<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>To View "Symbol of Failure" Please See</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/KO9VRe">http://mi.tt/KO9VRe</a><h4><b>AD FACTS: Script For "Symbol of Failure"</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>BRIAN ROSS, ABC NEWS: </b>"...[W]as a commitment with your tax dollars that ended up with the worst kind of return. $535 million for a California solar energy startup Solyndra by the Obama administration." <ul style="margin-left: 40px; "><li style="margin-left: 0.25in; "><b>BRIAN ROSS, ABC NEWS: </b>"...[W]as a commitment with your tax dollars that ended up with the worst kind of return. $535 million for a California solar energy startup Solyndra by the Obama administration."
