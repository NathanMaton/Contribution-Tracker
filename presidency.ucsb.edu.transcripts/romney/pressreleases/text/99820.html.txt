But that's exactly the type of career politician that Republican voters are tired of. If Washington excuses and insiders are the problem, Rick Santorum can't be the solution." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>On Wednesday, Senator Santorum Revealed Himself To Be "The Ultimate Washington Insider" By Going "Against The Principles [He] Believed In" And Taking "One For The Team":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Senator Santorum: "Sometimes You Take One For The Team ... Politics Is A Team Sport, Folks." </b>SANTORUM: "It was against the principles I believed in, but, you know, when you're part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake. You know, politics is a team sport, folks. And sometimes you've got to rally together and do something." (GOP Presidential Debate, 2/22/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>National Journal</i>: Senator Santorum Sounded "Like The Ultimate Washington Insider." </b>"For more than a year, Rick Santorum has labored to cast himself as an outsider ready to go to Washington to challenge business as usual, which makes it all the more puzzling why he decided to use the crucial debate in Mesa to sound like the ultimate Washington insider. ... Perhaps his worst moment was his attempt to explain why he voted for No Child Left Behind even though he opposed it. There were echoes of John Kerry's 'I voted for it before I voted against it' only without Kerry's coherence." (George E.
