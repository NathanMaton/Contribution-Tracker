We can no longer maintain our status as a world power if we try to deal with the deficit by dramatic cuts to the military, as the Obama Administration seems to be inclined to do. I solidly endorse Governor Romney's position that we need to maintain a strong national defense."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
