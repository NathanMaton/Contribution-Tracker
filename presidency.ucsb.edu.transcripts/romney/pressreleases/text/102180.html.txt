   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Ohio Congressman Bob Latta made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower: <p>"Today, Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan laid out a bold strategy to secure America's energy independence, grow our economy, and create jobs by taking advantage of our vast domestic natural resources. As the only Ohioan serving on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, I have seen first-hand the benefits of ensuring that we have a safe and reliable energy infrastructure that provides good, high-paying jobs to people here at home rather than sending our economic resources to countries abroad. Furthermore, we can provide new life to our manufacturing sector by lowering energy costs and igniting the ingenuity of the private sector to drive investment in this sector of our economy. I support the Romney-Ryan plan for energy independence and look forward to working with them to enact a real and comprehensive national energy policy."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
