On Day One of his presidency, Mitt Romney will take immediate steps to get the economy moving again and put Americans back to work." –Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today, President Obama Returns To Cuyahoga Community College To Discuss The Economy:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Today, President Obama Will Speak At Cuyahoga Community College In Cleveland To Discuss The Economy. </b>"President Obama is scheduled to speak at the Cuyahoga Community College Metropolitan Campus in Cleveland Thursday just five minutes prior to when Romney himself is set to begin an event in Cincinnati.
