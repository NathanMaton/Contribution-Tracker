We can no longer afford to watch our children's dreams slip away because of the failed economic agenda of this President. Governor Romney is dedicated to stopping President Obama's attack on free enterprise and removing bureaucratic red tape and barriers to job creation for small businesses."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
