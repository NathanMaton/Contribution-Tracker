   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers today made the following statement on President Obama's claim that his economic policies have "worked":<p>"While President Obama continues pushing for job-killing policies &mdash; including higher taxes, massive deficit spending and more regulations on small-business owners &mdash; incomes have fallen, energy costs have risen and the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for 41 months in a row. The anemic 1.5 percent GDP growth reported last week only further underscores the fact that the President's economic plan hasn't worked. Middle-class Americans will continue to struggle unless we replace Barack Obama with Mitt Romney, who has a proven record of private-sector job creation and whose policies will put Americans back to work and build a stronger middle class."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
