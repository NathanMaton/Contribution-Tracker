After my election, I have more flexibility.' President Obama signaled that he's going to cave to Russia on missile defense, but the American people have a right to know where else he plans to be 'flexible' in a second term.&nbsp; Higher taxes, more spending and increased debt are all on the table as long as Barack Obama is in the White House, despite what he says publicly.
