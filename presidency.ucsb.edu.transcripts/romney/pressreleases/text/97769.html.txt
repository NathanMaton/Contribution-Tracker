"I am thrilled to have earned the support of so many respected legislators in Florida," said Mitt Romney. "They are champions for the taxpayer, fighting for the middle class that has been hit so hard by President Obama's failed economic policies. Their hard work in Tallahassee will help put many Floridians back to work. I'm excited to work with them to bring my message of reduced spending and fiscal restraint to Washington." "Florida Republicans are getting behind Mitt Romney because he is the one candidate with the leadership experience and conservative solutions to help fix our country's struggling economy," said Florida House Speaker Designate Will Weatherford. "I welcome these legislators who share Mitt Romney's vision for our country's future. They join an already impressive Florida team and I look forward to working with them to elect Mitt Romney and defeat President Obama in November 2012." <b>Members Of Florida Legislature Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>State Senator Nancy Detert</li> <li>State Senator Garrett Richter</li> <li>State Representative Doug Broxson</li> <li>State Representative Steve Crisafulli</li> <li>State Representative Marti Coley</li> <li>State Representative Fred Costello</li> <li>State Representative Jose Diaz</li> <li>State Representative Jim Frishe</li> <li>State Representative Eduardo "Eddy" Gonzalez</li> <li>State Representative Ana Rivas Logan</li> <li>State Representative Charles McBurney</li> <li>State Representative Larry Metz</li> <li>State Representative Peter Nehr</li> <li>State Representative Bryan Nelson</li> <li>State Representative Jeanette Nunez</li> <li>State Representative Jose Olivia</li> <li>State Representative Kathleen Passidomo</li> <li>State Representative Jimmy Patronis</li> <li>State Representative Ray Pilon</li> <li>State Representative Stephen Precourt</li> <li>State Representative Lake Ray</li> <li>State Representative Patrick Rooney</li> <li>State Representative John Tobia</li> <li>State Representative Mike Weinstein</li> </ul> <b>Florida Legislators Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>State Senator JD Alexander</li> <li>State Senator Mike Bennett</li> <li>State Senator Anitere Flores</li> <li>State Senator Evelyn Lynn</li> <li>State Senator John Thrasher</li> <li>State Senator Stephen Wise</li> <li>State Representative Richard Corcoran</li> <li>State Representative Daniel Davis</li> <li>State Representative Chris Dorworth</li> <li>State Representative Shawn Harrison</li> <li>State Representative Ed Hooper</li> <li>Speaker Designate Will Weatherford</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
