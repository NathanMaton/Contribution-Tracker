I think a Tea Partier would find it very interesting that Rick Santorum voted to raise the debt ceiling five times without getting compensating reductions in spending. I think the fact that he continues to defend earmarks, including his $500,000 earmark to the Pittsburgh Zoo for a polar bear exhibit. I don't think that's consistent with the principles of conservatism.
