Jim Talent</i></b> <p><b>CHRIS JANSING, MSNBC:</b> "Mitt Romney will announce that North America can achieve energy independence by 2020, but we also know that's something that's eluded every president since Richard Nixon. What's the cornerstone of the plan? Is it more drilling?" <p><b>SEN. JIM TALENT: </b>"Yeah, more exploration, a number of different places. Well, the important thing to remember, Chris, is that changing drilling techniques and new discoveries make this the goal of not only energy independence, but making the United States an energy superpower not only achievable, but probable. And we can do it in about the same amount of time it took us to get to the moon after Jack Kennedy announced that goal. And we're talking about 3 to 4 million new jobs, a trillion dollars in additional revenue for the states and the federal government, half a trillion dollars in additional GDP.&nbsp; And what we're going to do is stop the policies that have been suppressing production."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
