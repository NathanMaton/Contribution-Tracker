Since taking office, President Obama has devastated the middle class by failing to live up to his promises of fixing unemployment, lowering gas prices, decreasing health care costs, and addressing the unsustainable federal debt. As president, Mitt Romney will implement a bold, pro-growth jobs plan that will help all Americans recover from the broken Obama economy." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>During The 2008 Presidential Campaign, Vice President Joe Biden Claimed Barack Obama Was Not Prepared To Be President:</b></h4><p><b>In 2007, Then-Senator Biden Claimed That Then-Senator Obama Wasn't Ready To Be President.</b> QUESTION: "Senator Biden, you did go beyond talking about Pakistan.
