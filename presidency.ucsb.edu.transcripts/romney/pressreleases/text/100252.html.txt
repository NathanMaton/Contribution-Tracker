And I'm not going to apologize for being successful. I didn't inherit what I have. What I inherited from my parents, I gave away. Gave away to charity and to others. This is about making sure that America gets strong again with a good economy and I spent my life in the economy. I was successful in it. I know what it takes to create jobs and how to get entrepreneurs building businesses again. Right now, we've got a president that doesn't understand how the economy works. He's been attacking free enterprise and attacking personal freedom. We need to have a president who understands how this economy works and how to get people working again and how to get gasoline prices down. We've got a president in the same way has done almost everything wrong with regards to energy and almost everything wrong with regards to the economy. And I don't think it's because he's a bad guy.
