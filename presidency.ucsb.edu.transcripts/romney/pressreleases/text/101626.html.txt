His self-described 'hodgepodge' energy policy has been an abject failure. Whether blocking job-creating initiatives like the Keystone pipeline or wasting taxpayer money on boondoggles like Solyndra, President Obama doesn't have a clue when it comes to America's energy future." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>The Obama Administration Has Threatened To Veto Legislation That Would Expand Domestic Energy Production:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>On Monday, The Obama Administration Said In A Formal Statement That It Would Veto A House Bill That Would Require Vastly Wider Offshore Oil-And-Gas Leasing. </b>"The White House on Monday waved the veto pen at a House GOP bill that would require vastly wider offshore oil-and-gas leasing.
