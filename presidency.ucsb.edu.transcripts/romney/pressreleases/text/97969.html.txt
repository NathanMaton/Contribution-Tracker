His experience working in the real economy was evident tonight. No other candidate has the same knowledge of how jobs are created and what it will take for our economy to grow and for businesses to start hiring again. I am supporting him because I know that his experience and values are what the country needs to get on the right track."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
