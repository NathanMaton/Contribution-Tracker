South Carolina saw President Obama and his National Labor Relations Board put union bosses ahead of American business and workers when they sued Boeing in 2011. Clearly, we need leadership in the White House that will fight for all American jobs and all American workers – not just those approved by his friends running big unions."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
