Yesterday I launched my Plan for a Stronger Middle Class that will bring more jobs and more take home pay. My plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with twelve million new jobs created by the end of my first term. President Obama doesn't have a plan and believes that the private sector is 'doing fine.' Obviously, that is not the case. We've now gone 42 consecutive months with the unemployment rate above eight percent. Middle class Americans deserve better, and I believe America can do better." &mdash; Mitt Romney<h4><b>Last Month, The Nation Experienced Its 42nd Straight Month Of Unemployment Above 8%:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>In July, The Nation's "Unemployment Rose To 8.3 Percent." </b>"Unemployment rose to 8.3 percent.
