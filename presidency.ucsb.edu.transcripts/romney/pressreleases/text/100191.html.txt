On the issues about which Alabamians are most concerned, jobs and our federal spending problem, Mitt Romney has proposed bold solutions to fix our economy and fiscal mess. His first-hand experience in the private economy combined with his proven record of leadership as a governor make Mitt Romney uniquely qualified to tackle tough problems and get our country on the right track. That is why I support him, and that's why his momentum is building in Alabama. I urge all those who want a change of direction in Washington to vote for Mitt Romney on Tuesday."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
