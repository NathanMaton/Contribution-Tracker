   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama's response to even more bad economic news is a massive tax increase. It just proves again that the President doesn't have a clue how to get America working again and help the middle class. The President's latest bad idea is to raise taxes on families, job creators, and small businesses. Almost half a million fewer Americans are working today than the day Barack Obama took office, and we've just come through the worst job creation quarter in two years. Unlike President Obama, Governor Romney understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is raise taxes on anyone. He has a plan to permanently lower marginal rates, help middle-class Americans save and invest, and jumpstart economic growth and job creation." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Leading Democrats From Across The Country Have Voiced Skepticism For President Obama's Massive Tax Hike Plan:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"Former President Bill Clinton Told CNBC Tuesday That The US Economy Already Is In A Recession And Urged Congress To Extend All The Tax Cuts Due To Expire At The End Of The Year." </b>(Jeff Cox, "US Already in 'Recession,' Extend Tax Cuts: Bill Clinton," <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/47693595" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, 6/5/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Former Obama & Clinton Economic Advisor Larry Summers "Came Out Against The President's Position" On Tax Hikes. </b>"Another ally of President Obama on Wednesday came out against the president's position that tax rates on the wealthiest Americans should rise next year.
