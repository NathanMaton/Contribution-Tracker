I don't have to tell John's story; the world already knows it. But it is what today's holiday is all about: sacrifice, valor, honor, courage, and love of country. A lot of young Americans are risking their lives in distant battlefields today. Memorial Day is a day to give thanks to them, and to remember all of America's soldiers who have laid down their lives to defend our country. As we enjoy our barbecues with friends and families and loved ones, let's keep them in our thoughts and in our prayers."<p><i>To View "Thank You" Please See: </i><a href="http://mi.tt/Kt6Ztd" target="_blank">http://mi.tt/Kt6Ztd</a></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
