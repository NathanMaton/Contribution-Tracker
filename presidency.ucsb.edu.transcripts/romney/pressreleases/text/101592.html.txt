It is disconcerting that at a moment like this, the White House is unwilling to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital city. This is not a moment for distancing ourselves from Israel. If that is President Obama's intention, he should make it plain to the American people and the world. We deserve to know what our policy is toward Israel and whether the United States recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
