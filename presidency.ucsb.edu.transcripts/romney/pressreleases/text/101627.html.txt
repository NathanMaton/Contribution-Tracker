But nowhere has this trend been more apparent than in President Obama's failure to even meet with his own jobs council for 191 days. With so many middle-class families struggling in the Obama economy, Americans deserve a president who will put job creation first." &mdash; Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama Hasn't Made Time For His Jobs Council For 191 Days&nbsp; &mdash; But He's Made Time For Many Other Activities:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Held His Last Jobs Council Meeting 191 Days Ago. </b>(President Barack Obama, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/17/opening-and-closing-remarks-president-council-jobs-and-competitiveness" target="_blank">Remarks</a>, Washington, DC, 1/17/12)<ul><li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, On President Obama's Missing Jobs Council: "There's No Specific Reason, Except The President Has Obviously Got A Lot On His Plate." </b>"'There's no specific reason, except the president has obviously got a lot on his plate, but he continues to solicit and receive advice from numerous folks outside the administration about the economy about ideas that he can act on with Congress or administratively to help the economy grow and help create jobs,' Carney said in the White House's first on-the-record response to a POLITICO story noting the hiatus."
