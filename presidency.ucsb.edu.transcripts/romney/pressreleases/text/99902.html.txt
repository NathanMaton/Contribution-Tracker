It improves incentives to work, save, and invest, and should thus modestly increase the economy's long-run growth. It modestly improves the tax structure by reducing the tax code's bias against saving and investment, particularly when that saving and investment is done in corporate form. Romney's plan should also be expected to simplify the tax code, on balance."

The Pennsylvania Senator favors a top tax rate of 28% but he also wants to triple the child tax credit to $3,000. He'd have a hard time credibly doing both without blowing up the budget because the tax credit has almost no revenue feedback effect. It's a social gesture with little or no impact on economic growth. Meanwhile, on corporate taxes, Mr. Romney's tax cut applies to all companies equally. Mr. Santorum would cut the rate in half for most companies, except manufacturers would pay 0%. This is a form of industrial policy that would have every company lobbying to qualify as a manufacturer and would defeat the tax neutrality that is a main goal of tax reform."

Here is ATR's take. ... Eliminate the death tax and the AMT. ... This is a clear 'win' in the Romney plan. ... Lower the corporate income tax rate to 25%.&nbsp; This is good as far as it goes. ... Move from worldwide to territorial taxation.&nbsp; This is a great move."

And, in stark contrast to Obama and Santorum, Romney doesn't make the tax code worse by adding special give-aways."

This is right on the merits, and it will let Mr. Romney stand against another lobbying free-for-all to define what qualifies as 'manufacturing.'" (Paul Gigot, "Romney Vs.
