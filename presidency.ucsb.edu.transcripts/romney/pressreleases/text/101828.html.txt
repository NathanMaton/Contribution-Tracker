What can they expect from a Romney Presidency? Obviously, we've heard your remarks here. A stronger alliance? A closer relationship?"<p><b>MITT ROMNEY: </b>"Well, I don't want to be in any way critical of the President while I'm on foreign soil of course, at the same time I think we can all agree that our relationship with Poland goes a long way back and Poland has been fighting side-by-side with us in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have lost lives in those places; they have stood with us in tough times. It's important for us to stand with them, in good times and in bad. Right now these are good times for them. Their economy is the strongest in Europe. But I think we should have a very close relationship with a government that is doing its very best to promote economic prosperity for all of their people, to welcome foreign investment, to expand international trade.&nbsp; Poland is getting some things right. We could probably learn something from what's happening right here."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
