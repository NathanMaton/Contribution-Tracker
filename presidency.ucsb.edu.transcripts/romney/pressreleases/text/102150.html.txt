It's personal security that has been there for my family when we need it. I had my mom Betty down with me in Florida on Saturday. She has been on Medicare for over 10 years. When my grandma moved in with my mom and me and we were her caregivers, when she was suffering Alzheimer's, Medicare was there when our family needed it then; it's there for my mom when she needs it now. And what President Obama will not tell you is that his signature achievement, Obamacare, raids $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. What's more, he puts this new board of fifteen unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats that he is about to appoint, who are required to cut Medicare every year in ways that will clearly lead to denied care for current seniors. His campaign calls this an achievement. Do you think raiding Medicare to pay for Obamacare and putting bureaucrats in charge of cutting it is an achievement? I don't think so, either."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
