I know how jobs come and go. I worked in a state. I found a way to work across the aisle, by the way. We've got to have someone that goes to Washington that buries the hatchet and says you know what: there are good Democrats, there are good Republicans that care about America. Let's work together to get the American people working, get some growth again."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
