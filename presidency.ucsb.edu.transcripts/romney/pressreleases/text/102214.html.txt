   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Staples Founder Tom Stemberg today made the following statement on the dismal jobs report:&nbsp; <p>"This morning's appalling unemployment numbers show that our country is not where it needs to be. In the year Mitt Romney was born, unemployment in America was 3.9 percent. In the year Mitt Romney turned 21, it was 3.6 percent. There's no iron law of economics that is keeping unemployment above 8 percent. The fact that unemployment has been over 8 percent for 43 straight months is the result of President Obama's economic mismanagement. It's time that we had a president who understands how our economy creates jobs and how Washington can get out of the way of that process." <p>*Company/business names are provided for identification purposes only.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
