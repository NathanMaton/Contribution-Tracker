   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Rick Santorum is trying to label himself a conservative, but his record tells a different story. When it comes to Big Labor, Santorum has been about as conservative as Barack Obama. Labor bosses want to force every worker to pay dues and join a union to hold a job. As a U.S. Senator, Santorum supported their agenda. He even filibustered right to work legislation that would have given every American a chance to hold a job without joining a union. That's not conservatism - it's the liberal program of Big Labor." &mdash;Greg Hartmann, Hamilton County Commissioner<h4 align="left"><b>Ohio Voters Strongly Support Efforts To Pass A Right-To-Work Law In Their State:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>A Recent Ohio Poll Showed State Voters Strongly In Favor Of A Right-To-Work Law. </b>"By a 54-to-40 percent margin, voters surveyed for a Quinnipiac University poll said they would support a 'right-to-work' law that has been proposed by Ohio Tea Party activists.

This shields unions from competition on federal construction projects. It will also add $10.9 billion to the deficit in 2011.
