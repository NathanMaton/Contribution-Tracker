We expect attacks on free enterprise from President Obama and his allies on the left - not from so-called 'fiscal conservatives.' Speaker Gingrich and Governor Perry seem to think that running against the private sector is the way to revive their floundering campaigns. Governor Romney will continue talking about his experience in the real economy, his vision for getting America back to work, and how important it is that we defeat President Obama in November." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson</center><p><b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b><b>'s Fred Barnes: </b>"Newt Gingrich has adopted an anti-free market argument - a favorite of the political left - to criticize Mitt Romney."
