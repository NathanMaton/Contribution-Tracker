   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama campaigned for office on a very specific promise to decrease health care premiums by $2,500. By his own standard, the President has failed and middle-class families are the ones suffering the consequences. It's time for President Obama to take responsibility for his middle-class promise gap. And it's time for a new direction and new president who will finally deliver change for struggling middle-class families." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<p><b><i><a href="http://mi.tt/N6ug66" target="_blank">Click Here</a> To View The Latest Middle-Class Promise Gap Infographic</i></b><h4><b>President Obama's Middle-Class Promise Gap On Health Care Has Resulted In $4,893 In Higher Premiums For Families:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In February 2008: "We're Going To Work With You To Lower Your Premiums By $2,500 Per Family Per Year. ... We Will Do It By The End Of My First Term As President Of The United States Of America." </b>OBAMA: "If you are ready for change, then we can stop talking about the outrage of 47 million people without health insurance and start doing something about it. ... If you've got health insurance, we're going to work with you to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year. And we will not wait 20 years from now to do it or 10 years from now to do it. We will do it by the end of my first term as president of the United States of America."

Independent health care experts say the law has caused some insurance premiums to rise. As we wrote in October, the new law has caused about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored family plans because of requirements for increased benefits. Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made - that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.'"
