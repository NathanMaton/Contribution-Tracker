   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"In recent years, President Obama has admitted that Medicare 'is going broke.' But instead of working toward a solution, the President cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for his disastrous health care law and stuck America's seniors and future retirees with the bill. As president, Mitt Romney will protect Medicare for seniors and ensure that the program is strengthened and saved for future retirees." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Three Years Ago Today, President Obama Warned Medicare "Is Going Broke" &mdash; And It's Still On Track To Be Broke By 2024:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama, On Medicare Three Years Ago Today: "Mark My Words ...

For first time, the bill also applies Medicare's 2.9% payroll tax rate to investment income, including dividends, interest income and capital gains. Added to the 0.9% payroll surcharge, that means a 3.8-percentage point tax hike on 'the rich.' Oh, and these new taxes aren't indexed for inflation, so many middle-class families will soon be considered rich and pay the surcharge as their incomes rise past $250,000 due to tax-bracket creep. Remember how the Alternative Minimum Tax was supposed to apply only to a handful of millionaires? Taxpayer cost over 10 years: $210 billion."
