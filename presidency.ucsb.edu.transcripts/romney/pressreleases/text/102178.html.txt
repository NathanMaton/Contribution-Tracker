   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama concedes that 'we aren't where we need to be.' Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan agree. The American people know they aren't better off than they were four years ago. President Obama has added trillions to our national debt, blocked domestic energy production, and presided over the highest chronic unemployment in recorded history. He promised to change how Washington works, but he admits the nation's capital is as broken as ever. He raided Medicare to pay for Obamacare and is proposing massive tax increases that will kill jobs and hurt our economy. Too many middle-class families are going to sleep each night worried about the future. This may be the best President Obama can do, but it's not the best America can do. The Romney-Ryan plan for a stronger middle class will jump start our economy and create 12 million new jobs – and most importantly, give Americans hope for a better future." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman <h4><b>President Obama Promised To Change Washington – But After Nearly Four Years In Office, Even He Admits Washington Is Still Broken:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama, On The Current State Of Washington: "More Of The Same. ...
