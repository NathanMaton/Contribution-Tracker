"These leaders share my goals of reversing President Obama's failed policies and bringing jobs back to the state. I look forward to working with them as I continue to campaign across Nevada." <p>"Nevadans are tired of the excuses coming from President Obama," said Assemblyman Cresent Hardy. "After three years of failed leadership on the economy, it is time for a change in the White House. Americans want a leader with proven experience creating jobs and working in the economy – that man is Mitt Romney." <p>"Mitt Romney has the needed experience to get our economy back on track and fix the fiscal mess in Washington," said Assemblyman Pat Hickey. "As governor, he created jobs and balanced the budget, all without raising taxes. His experience in the private sector and as governor stands in contrast to the failed leadership we have seen from the White House over the past three years." <p><b>Members Of Nevada Assembly Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>Assemblyman Ed Goedhart</li> <li>Assemblyman Scott Hammond</li> <li>Assemblyman Cresent Hardy</li> <li>Assemblyman Pat Hickey</li> <li>Assemblyman Kelly Kite</li> <li>Assemblyman Pete Livermore</li> <li>Assemblyman Mark Sherwood</li> <li>Assemblyman Lynn Stewart</li> <li>Assemblywoman Melissa Woodbury</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
