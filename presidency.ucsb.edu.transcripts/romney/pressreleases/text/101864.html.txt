   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan today made the following statement on the July employment report:<p>"Today's jobs report again confirms what millions of families across the nation already know: that President Obama has broken his promises, his economic policies have failed, and his lack of leadership has been a grave disappointment. Taking more from hardworking taxpayers to grow government, as the President has been doing, results in the kind of sluggish private-sector job creation we have been seeing for far too long. Americans deserve better. Where President Obama has failed, Mitt Romney will deliver. He has a proven record and a bold plan that will return our country to the right path, the path of dynamism, innovation, and prosperity."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
