"They recognize, like most Americans, that our economy is struggling today because of President Obama's failed policies. I look forward to working with them to bring my message of job creation and reduced spending to all Georgians."<p>Announcing his support, Labor Commissioner Mark Butler said, "Mitt Romney has the temperament, experience, and leadership we need to move our country forward. I am confident he will put policies in place that will foster job growth and encourage businesses to hire because he spent his life in the private sector and understands how the real economy works. I am proud to support his campaign for president."<p><b>Georgia Elected Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Labor Commissioner Mark Butler<br>  State Senator Cecil Stanton, Majority Whip<br>  State Senator Johnny Grant<br>  State Senator Greg Goggins<br>  State Senator Jeff Mullis<br>  State Representative Jan Tankersley<br>  State Representative Mike Jacobs<br>  State Representative Ben Harbin<br>  State Representative Allen Peake<br>  State Representative Jay Neal<br>  State Representative Tom Taylor<br>  State Representative Alex Atwood<br>  Sandy Springs Mayor Eva Galambos<br>  Johns Creek Mayor Michael Bodker<br>  Fulton County Commissioner Liz Hausmann<br>  Chatham County Commissioner Helen Stone<br>  Gwinnett Commissioner Mike Beaudreau<br>  Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman<br>  City of Monroe Chief of Police Keith Glass<p><b>Georgia Elected Officials Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Attorney General Sam Olens<br>Former House Speaker Mark Burkhalter<br>State Senator Bill Hamrick, Chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee<br>State Senator Fran Millar<br>State Representative Calvin Hill, Vice Chairman of House Appropriations Committee<br>State Representative &amp; House Majority Whip Edward Lindsey<br>State Representative Wendell Willard, Chairman of House Judiciary Committee<br>State Representative Bruce Williamson<br>State Representative B.J.
