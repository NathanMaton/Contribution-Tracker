There's no question that under this president, this recovery has been the most tepid, the most weak, the most painful, since the beginning of our recorded economic history. And I'm including the Great Depression. I saw a report yesterday in the Wall Street Journal which laid out the rate of growth in our economy post-this downturn and it has been a slower recovery that even that which occurred during that which occurred during the years of the Great Depression.
