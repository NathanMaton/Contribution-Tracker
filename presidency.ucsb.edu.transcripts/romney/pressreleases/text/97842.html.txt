   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements of elected officials and leaders in Georgia. "It's an honor to receive the support of these great Georgians," said Mitt Romney. "They share my vision for reduced government spending and regulation in order to get the economy moving again. I'm looking forward to working with them to bring my message to all Georgians." Announcing his support, State Senator Fran Millar, who also endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008, said, "I am proud to support Mitt Romney for president. He is the only candidate with both the conservative record and plan to get our economy on the right track again. After three years, it is clear that we cannot afford to elect a president without experience working in the economy. Mitt Romney will bring the skills of a successful businessman and governor to help fix our economy. With his leadership in Washington, I have no doubt that we will be able to reverse the failures of the last three years and get Americans working again." State Representative B.J. Pak said, "It is clear that President Obama's liberal policies are not helping Georgians or the rest of the country. Mitt Romney has a record of leadership as a conservative businessman and as a governor who was able to cut taxes and spending. He knows that we need those conservative principles in the White House if we are to turn around the economy – that is why Georgians will support his effort to defeat President Obama." <b>Georgia Elected Officials And Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>Fran Millar, State Senator</li> <li>B.J.
