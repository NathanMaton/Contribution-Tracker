They've lost their jobs. They're working twice as hard and making half as much. Their kids are graduating college and they can't find a job, but they're stuck with student loans and they have to move back in with their parents. This is real life. And I think Barack Obama is going to be held to account for that. He's going to have to explain to all Americans, including Americans of Hispanic descent, why things have not gotten better despite the fact that he's gotten everything he's asked for. And that's where I think Mitt Romney's approach is going to create an appeal to all Americans, especially those of Hispanic descent."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
