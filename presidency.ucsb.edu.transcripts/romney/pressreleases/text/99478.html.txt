"This shows that my message of a simpler, smaller, and smarter federal government is resonating with the American people. With the help of these leaders, I look forward to bringing this message to Arizona."<p>"This administration's financial policies have decimated the middle class," said Mesa Mayor Scott Smith. "We simply cannot afford to continue policies that increase unemployment and mortgage our grandchildren's future to China. Mitt Romney has a detailed jobs plan to get Americans back to work and rebuild the middle class. I am confident he will also fix the generations-long problem of illegal immigration. He is the conservative champion we need in the White House."<p><b>Arizona Elected Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>State Senator Jerry Lewis (Member of Appropriations, Education, Economic Development &amp; Job Creation, and Border Security Committee)<p>State Representative Kate Brophy McGee (Energy of Natural Resources Vice-Chairwoman)<p>State Representative Jack Harper (Chairman of Ways &amp; Means Committee)<p>State Representative John Kavanagh (Appropriations Chairman)<p>State Representative David Smith (Vice-Chairman of Judiciary)<p>Mayor Scott Smith (Mesa)<p>Mayor Hugh Hallman (Tempe)<p>Mayor Gail A.
