Governor Romney will put an end to the failed policies of this administration by creating a competitive environment to foster job creation and reduce the burdensome regulations stifling economic growth. These are the kinds of policies that bring good jobs to our communities and provide a better future to all Americans."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
