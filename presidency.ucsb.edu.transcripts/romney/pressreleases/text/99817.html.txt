Mitt Romney has proposed a bold solution to actually fix the major economic problems facing our country: high taxes, out-of-control spending, and the need to reform entitlements. No other candidate in either party can claim such an ambitious and sweeping vision. This audacious leadership is the reason I am proud to stand with Mitt."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
