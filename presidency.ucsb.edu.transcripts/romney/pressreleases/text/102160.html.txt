Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now." – Paul Ryan <p><b>Remarks<br />Greenville, NC</b><br /><b>September 3, 2012</b> <p style="margin-left:.5in;"><b><i>Click </i></b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHtFkBDubp0&feature=em-share_video_user"><b><i>Here</i></b></a><b><i> To Watch Paul Ryan</i></b> <p><b>PAUL RYAN: </b>"In July of 1980, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. For the past 42 months, it's been above 8 percent under Barack Obama's failed leadership. When businesses go bankrupt, that means fewer paychecks, fewer jobs. The unemployment rate in North Carolina is 9.6 percent. In 1980, under Jimmy Carter 330,000 businesses filed for bankruptcy*. Last year, under President Obama's failed leadership, 1.4 million businesses filed for bankruptcy*. We have a very clear choice. Take a look at people who are having a hard time making their mortgage payments. 77,000 delinquent mortgages by the time Jimmy Carter left office. Under President Obama, 3 million. So, when you take a look at what we're going to hear in Charlotte today, the President can say a lot of things, and he will, but he can't tell you that you're better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now." <p><i>*Note: Paul Ryan was referring to total bankruptcies.</i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
