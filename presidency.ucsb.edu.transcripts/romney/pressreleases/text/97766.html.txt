"I am excited to work with these great leaders to help spread my pro-growth message across New Hampshire and put America back on the path to prosperity." <p>"Governor Romney demonstrated in last week's debate that he is the only Republican capable of defeating President Obama in 2012. Mitt is clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the field when it comes to understanding the free market and what it will take to put people back to work," said Representative John Tholl, a former Coos County Republican Committee Chairman. "In 2012, Republicans want a leader who knows how to cut taxes, reduce bloated government spending and turn around our struggling economy. That leader is Mitt Romney." <p>Romney has previously announced the endorsement of nine other New Hampshire State Representatives, four New Hampshire State Senators, two executive councilors and two Sheriffs. <p><b>State Representatives Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>State Representative John Tholl (R-Whitefield)</li> <li>State Representative Carl Seidel (R-Nashua)</li> <li>State Representative Ken Hawkins (R-Bedford)</li> <li>State Representative David Welch (R-Kingston)</li> <li>State Representative Barry Palmer (R-Nashua)</li> <li>State Representative John O'Connor (R-Derry)</li> <li>State Representative Robert Rowe (R-Amherst)</li> <li>State Representative Frank Sterling (R-Jaffrey)</li> <li>State Representative Molly Smith (R-Hooksett)</li> <li>State Representative Michael Weeden (R-Dover)</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
