When supporters collect payments, funds are deposited in the campaign's bank account the next business day. The campaign ensures FEC compliance by easily collecting the required information within the app during the contribution process. <p>Square devices will also be provided to each Victory location.&nbsp; <p>Visit Online at: <a href="http://www.MittRomney.com/Square">www.MittRomney.com/Square</a></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
