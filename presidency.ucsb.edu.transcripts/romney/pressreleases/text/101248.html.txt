For many young adults in the Hispanic community, the unemployment rate is unacceptably high. In America, a land of promise and opportunity, this is heartbreaking and unacceptable. Mitt Romney has a plan to get our country back to work. Like all Americans, the Hispanic community wants a President who will help job creators not hinder them. In November, by electing Mitt Romney, we can choose a different path and begin the work of restoring America's promise."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
