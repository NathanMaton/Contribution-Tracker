   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"For nearly four years, President Obama has presided over reckless spending and runaway debt. And now it's clear that all Americans will pay the price, with another potential credit downgrade and over $5 trillion in new debt that the next generation will be forced to repay. Americans deserve real leadership – not a president who is content to keep passing our bills on to the next generation." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Yesterday, Moody's Announced The Potential For A Credit Downgrade Due To Inaction On The Debt:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Moody's Warned It Would Strip The United States' AAA Credit Rating If The Nation Did Not Adequately Address Its Long-Term Debt Trajectory. </b>"Moody's Investors Service warned Tuesday that Congress will need to strike a deal on the 'fiscal cliff' to avoid a second downgrade to the nation's credit rating. The rating agency said that budget negotiations in 2013 will likely determine the fate of the nation's credit rating, adding that an inability to strike a deal with 'specific policies' to change the nation's debt trajectory would likely mean a downgrade.&nbsp; Moody's still rates the nation as a top-shelf AAA credit, but with a negative outlook as it has warned policymakers they must adjust the nation's fiscal course to retain its financial reputation."

The credit rating firm said negotiations between Congress and the White House on the nation's 2013 budget, and whether they will reduce the high ratio of debt to gross domestic product, will be key to maintaining its top credit rating."

It downgraded long-term U.S. debt to AA+, a score that ranks below more than a dozen governments', including Liechtenstein's, and on par with Belgium's and New Zealand's. S&P also put the new grade on 'negative outlook,' meaning the U.S. has little chance of regaining the top rating in the near term."

But you reach the conclusion in this case, in this struggle Barack Obama did not?" WOODWARD: "Yes, simply because our financial house is not in order. In other words, the big debate last year about the debt ceiling and whether the U.S. government is going to be able to pay its bills, it isn't over. We're going to be right back in that soup in December and January. And this isn't a budget issue, or a credit rating issue. This is the government going to have its money to pay its bills.
