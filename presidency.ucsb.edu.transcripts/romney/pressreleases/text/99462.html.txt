He also laid out a clear history of his time as Governor of Massachusetts, a conservative battling liberals in a deep blue state.<h2 align="center"><b>SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE VALUES</b></h2><h4><b>As Governor, Romney Defended Traditional Marriage In A Deep Blue State:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Gov. Romney Called For A Massachusetts Constitutional Amendment Defining Marriage As Between A Man And A Woman.</b> "I disagree with the Supreme Judicial Court. Marriage is an institution between a man and a woman. I will support an amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution to make that expressly clear." (Office Of The Governor, "Statement By Governor Mitt Romney On SJC Decision On Same Sex Marriage," Press Release, 11/18/03)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Gov. Romney Enforced A 1913 Law Preventing Out-Of-State Same-Sex Couples From Marrying In Massachusetts.</b> "Same-sex couples who live outside Massachusetts will not be able to marry in Massachusetts when gay marriage becomes legal here next month, Gov. Mitt Romney said. ... Mr. Romney said he was basing his decision on a 48-word law, adopted in 1913, which says that the state cannot marry an out-of-state couple if their marriage would be 'void' in their home state." (Pam Belluck, "Romney Won't Let Gay Outsiders Wed In Massachusetts," The New York Times, 4/25/04)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>In June 2004, Gov. Romney Testified Before The United States Congress In Support Of The Federal Marriage Amendment.</b> "Society can ill afford erosion of charitable institutions. For these reasons, I join with those who support a federal constitutional amendment. (...) While they say they agree with the traditional definition of marriage, they hesitate to amend. But amendment is a vital and necessary aspect of our constitutional democracy, not an aberration."

Mitt Romney vetoed a bill Friday to expand stem cell experiments in Massachusetts because it would allow the cloning of human embryos &mdash; a practice he has called morally wrong. ... He has said that amounts to creating human life only to destroy it. 'It is wrong to allow science to take an assembly line approach to the production of human embryos, the creation of which will be rooted in experimentation and destruction,' Romney wrote in a letter to lawmakers explaining the veto." (Theo Emery, "Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney Vetoes Stem Cell Bill," <i>The Associated Press</i>, 5/27/05)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Romney Vetoed Legislation That Would Have Expanded Access To The "Morning After Pill" Without A Prescription.</b> "Yesterday I vetoed a bill that the Legislature forwarded to my desk. Though described by its sponsors as a measure relating to contraception, there is more to it than that. The bill does not involve only the prevention of conception: The drug it authorizes would also terminate life after conception." (Governor Mitt Romney, Op-Ed, "Why I Vetoed The Contraception Bill," <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 7/26/05)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Romney Directed Funds To A Faith-Based Organization For Abstinence Education.</b> "Governor Mitt Romney yesterday announced that the state will funnel nearly $1 million in federal funds to a faith-based organization to teach abstinence to public middle school students in a dozen more communities across the state.

Today, the board of Catholic Charities voted to stop doing adoptions because of state law which requires that gays be given equal consideration for the placement of children. Because of the Church's teaching, Catholic agencies may not provide adoptions to gay parents. 'This is a sad day for neglected and abandoned children. In this case, it's a mistake for our laws to put the rights of adults over the needs of children. While I respect the board's decision to stay true to their principles, I find the current state of the law deeply disturbing and a threat to religious freedom,' said Romney."
