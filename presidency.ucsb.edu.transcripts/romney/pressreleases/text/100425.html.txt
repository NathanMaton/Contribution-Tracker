Rick Santorum said that should the Court rule that the government cannot punish those who refuse to buy insurance, the Republican presidential candidate would deserve some of the credit &mdash; all because he supported fellow Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican who later joined the Democratic Party. 'As a reminder, as we watch this whole Obamacare Supreme Court review unfold, it is very important to understand that if Rick Santorum hadn't supported Specter, there is no guarantee that we would have had [Justice Samuel] Alito and [Chief Justice John] Roberts who are going to play, probably, a major role in this,' Santorum's top adviser, John Brabender, told <i>The Huffington Post</i>. 'He was very firm with Specter that he needed Bush's conservative judges to be confirmed ... And as you know, Specter did that. The proof is in the pudding.'"
