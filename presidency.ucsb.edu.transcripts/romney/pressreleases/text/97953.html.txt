I'm happy to help legal immigrants but illegal immigrants coming here getting a break – a $100,000 break on college tuition financed by taxpayers makes no sense." – Mitt Romney <p>"Jordan Sekulow Show" September 27, 2011 <p><i>Listen To Segment Here</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/qwrVVA">http://mi.tt/qwrVVA</a> <p><b>Segment From "Jordan Sekulow Show":</b> <p>Mitt Romney: "I fundamentally believe that it doesn't make a lot of sense for American taxpayers to pay for the college education of illegal aliens particularly at a time when American taxpayers are having a hard time financing education for their own children. It's a strange thing. I know that it's popular to get some votes in some corners. But from a policy standpoint if we're going to give benefits that are worth $100,000 to illegal aliens to come here and get a higher education degree, then people are going to try and get into the country illegally. That's the kind of magnet that draws people into the country. It's the wrong course for our nation. Look, I love legal immigration. I'm happy to help legal immigrants but illegal immigrants coming here getting a break – a $100,000 break on college tuition financed by taxpayers makes no sense."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
