"They understand that President Obama's new regulations and tax-and-spend policies have failed to stimulate our economy and have only left our country mired in debt and uncertainty. As Americans make a critical decision about the future direction of this country, Florida will be an important state. This team will be essential to my campaign as I reach out to voters. With the help of these committed public servants, I am confident that we can defeat President Obama and turn around this struggling economy." <p>"We're all proud to get behind Mitt in his campaign for president," said Congressman Connie Mack. "He will provide the conservative leadership Washington desperately needs. Florida voters are looking for a president who will bring back jobs to this country, restore economic growth, and get our fiscal house in order. From the private sector to the Olympics to Massachusetts, Mitt has the proven track record of successful problem-solving that will be required to get our economy moving again and Americans back to work. He is the best candidate to take on and defeat President Obama in 2012. I am glad to be part of his Florida team." <p><b>Honorary Co-Chairs:</b> <ul> <li>Congressman Ander Crenshaw</li> <li>Congressman Connie Mack</li> <li>Congressman Tom Rooney</li> </ul> <p><b>State Chairman:</b> <ul> <li>Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam</li> </ul> <p><b>State Finance Chairman:</b> <ul> <li>Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater</li> </ul> <p><b>Finance Co-Chairs:</b> <ul> <li>Brian Ballard</li> <li>Jay Demetree</li> <li>Ambassador John Rood</li> </ul> <p><b>Florida Co-Chairs:</b> <ul> <li>State Senator John Thrasher</li> <li>Speaker Allan Bense</li> <li>Pat Neal</li> <li>Remedios Diaz-Oliver</li> <li>Tom Lee</li> <li>Will Weatherford</li> <li>Anitere Flores</li> <li>Justin Sayfie</li> <li>Slater Bayliss</li> <li>David Griffin</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
