"The endorsements of these leaders show that my message of more jobs, smaller government and less debt is resonating with the American people. In the months to come, these conservatives will be crucial in helping me spread my message to Michigan voters."<p>Announcing his support, Kent County Commissioner Harold Voorhees said, "Michigan voters are looking for a conservative leader who can create jobs, balance the budget, and repeal Obamacare. I believe that Mitt Romney is the candidate to do just that. America cannot take another four years of Barack Obama's failed policies and broken promises. Mitt Romney has the proven experience and bold vision to get our nation back on track. I urge fellow conservatives to join me in voting for Mitt Romney."<h4><b>West Michigan Leaders Supporting Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p><b>Kent County Commissioner Harold Voorhees</b><br>President of Serve-U-Sweets Inc., a local cookie and snack food distributor, Harold Voorhees began elected service in 1987 when elected to the Wyoming City Council.
