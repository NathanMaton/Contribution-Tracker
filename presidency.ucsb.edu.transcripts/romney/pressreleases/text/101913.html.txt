But that didn't stop the Obama Administration &mdash; and American taxpayers and the 1,800 unemployed workers are the ones still paying the price." &mdash; Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Internal White House Emails Reveal "Concern, Frustration" From President Obama's Inner Circle On The Solyndra Loan:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Emails Between President Obama's Senior Advisers "Reveal Concern, Frustration" As Solyndra Headed Toward Bankruptcy. </b>"Emails between White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer and then-Deputy Senior Advisor Stephanie Cutter reveal concern, frustration as former poster-child for clean energy investment failed.

The Post's story says the report 'suggests' that Lew — in his previous role as director of the Office of Management and Budget — 'let the refinancing move forward without intervening, even though some OMB analysts thought a refinancing plan that favored private investors might violate the law.'"

The restructuring went forward, but within months Solyndra failed anyway, leaving federal taxpayers on the hook for much of the half-billion-dollar federal loan. Now, a year after&nbsp;the company's collapse, debate continues over whether the refinancing plan was legal or a wise investment. Last week, Solyndra's final liquidation plan estimated that the government will recover just $24 million of the $527 million that taxpayers lent to the company."
