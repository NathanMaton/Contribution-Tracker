Romney also did well in casting himself as the anti-Obama. Where Obama lacked business experience, Romney has it in spades. Where Obama made sweeping promises, Romney made simple ones. (The most quoted line of the speech will almost certainly be this one: 'President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise...is to help you and your family.')"
