   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Silence." Yesterday, President Obama launched his campaign by telling Americans not to ask if they are better off than they were four years ago, but how they'll be tomorrow. This follows a jobs report that found more than 340,000 Americans dropping out of the labor force and an unemployment rate that remains unacceptably high.<p><i>To View "Silence" Please See</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/IMzwLQ">http://mi.tt/IMzwLQ</a><h4><b>AD FACTS: Script For "Silence"</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS: "Tonight, new evidence the economic recovery is slowing."</b><ul style="margin-left: 80px; "><li style="margin-left: 0.25in; "><b>SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS: </b>"Tonight, new evidence that the economic recovery is slowing."
