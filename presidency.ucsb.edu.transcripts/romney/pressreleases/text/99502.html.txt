"Under my economic plan, Wyoming will be able to develop its natural resources and be a leader in our country's economic comeback. I look forward to working with these leaders to help Wyoming reach its full potential."<p>State Chair Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis said, "Wyoming has faced first-hand the consequences of President Obama's big-government over-regulation that has hindered our state's economic development. Mitt Romney knows that the best thing Washington can do is to get out of the way of job creators. President Obama's approach to government has been to balloon government and put us on a path toward Greece. Mitt Romney will shrink government, put an end to burdensome regulations, and create an environment where small businesses can thrive. I urge fellow Wyoming voters to support Mitt Romney &mdash; our country can't afford four more years of failed leadership."<p><b>State Chair</b><p>Cynthia Lummis, United States Representative<p><b>State Co-Chairs:</b><p>Senator Jim Anderson, Wyoming Senate President <p>Senator Eli Bebout <p>Greg Schaefer, Wyoming Republican National Committeeman <p><b>State Steering Committee:</b><p>Senator Ray Peterson <p>Senator Ogden Driskill <p>Senator Stan Cooper <p>Senator Leland Christensen <p>Senator Wayne Johnson <p>Senator Dan Dockstader <p>Representative David Miller <p>Representative Robert McKim <p>Representative Tom Lockhart <p>Representative Michael Madden<p>Representative Ruth Ann Petroff<p>Representative Elaine Harvey<p>Representative Matt Greene<p>Bruce Brown, Former Crook County Republican Party Chair and WY Republican Party Vice Chair <p>Ron Micheli, Former Wyoming House Leader and Director of WY Department of Agriculture <p>Dr. Jason Whitman, WY Young Republicans Chair and YRNF National Policy Committee Chairman <p>Marilyn Taylor, Park County GOP Activist <p>Bill Cubin, Former Natrona County Republican Party Chair <p>Haley Davis, Campaign Manager For Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis<p>Clay Long, Laramie County Young Republicans Chair <p>Bill Novotny, Campaign Manager for Governor Matt Mead<p></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
