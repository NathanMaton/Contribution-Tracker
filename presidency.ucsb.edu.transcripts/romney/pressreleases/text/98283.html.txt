They join a growing grassroots team supporting Mitt Romney's campaign.<p>"As our momentum builds, I'm so thankful to have such a strong grassroots team helping to lead my campaign in Michigan," said Mitt Romney. "Michigan is home for me and I will work my hardest with these leaders to bring jobs back to the state and reinvigorate the state's economy."&nbsp;<p>Announcing the addition of grassroots leaders to Mitt Romney's team, Michigan Republican Party Treasurer Carl Meyer said, "Michigan grassroots leaders are lining up behind Mitt Romney because the state and the country's economic well-being is dependent on defeating President Obama and reversing his failed policies.
