   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Illinois Congresswoman Judy Biggert. <p>"I am happy to have the support of these important leaders in Illinois," said Mitt Romney. "I look forward to partnering with them in our efforts to get America back to work." <p>"During my years in the House, I was an advocate for balanced budgets and low taxes," said Hastert. "Mitt Romney stands up for these principles. President Obama has failed to get millions of unemployed Americans back to work. From his success in the private sector, Mitt Romney understands how to create jobs and turn around this economy. At this critical moment, our country needs his leadership in the White House." <p>Announcing her support, Congresswoman Judy Biggert said, "President Obama's spend-tax-and-regulate policies have only served to drive up the debt and create more uncertainty for struggling American families and job creators. Mitt Romney's plan to get America back to work is rooted not only in sound economic principles, but also in the extensive real-world experience that he brings to the table. I am proud to support him." <p><b>Background On Speaker Hastert And Congresswoman Biggert:</b> <p>Dennis Hastert Is The Former Speaker Of The House Of Representatives.
