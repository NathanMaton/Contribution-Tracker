   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced the endorsements from five Tennessee State Senators.<p>"I am proud to announce the support of more Tennessee leaders to my growing team in the state," said Mitt Romney. "Tennesseans are looking for a president who will stop the over-spending, over-regulating, and over-taxation coming from Washington. My economic plan will free the American entrepreneurial spirit and allow for job-creators in Tennessee to innovate and expand without Washington getting in the way."<p>"Mitt Romney's plan for more jobs, less debt and smaller government is the pro-growth plan that conservatives have been waiting for," said State Senate Caucus Chair Bill Ketron. "By shrinking government and cutting taxes, Mitt Romney will make our country more globally competitive. After three years of President Obama, job creators have pulled back due to the uncertainty created by this administration. With Mitt Romney as president, job creators will be able to grow, hire, and get our country back on track."<h4><b>Tennessee State Senators Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p>State Senator Mike Faulk &mdash; Church Hill<br>State Senator Jack Johnson &mdash; Franklin<br>State Senator Brian Kelsey &mdash; Germantown<br>State Senator Bill Ketron &mdash; Murfreesboro<br>State Senator Jim Tracy &mdash; Shelbyville<h4><b>Tennessee Elected Officials Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p>Governor Bill Haslam<br>Former Governor Winfield Dunn<br>Congressman Jimmy Duncan<br>Congresswoman Diane Black<br>Congressman Phil Roe<br>Speaker of the House Beth Harwell<br>Rep.
