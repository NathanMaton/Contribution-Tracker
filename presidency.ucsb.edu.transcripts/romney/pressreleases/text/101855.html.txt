   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Paul Ryan hails from an agriculture state and supported disaster relief, and the truth is no one will work harder to defend farmers and ranchers than the Romney-Ryan ticket.&nbsp; After nearly four years of failure, it's no wonder that Barack Obama returns to the state that launched his presidential campaign with nothing more than broken promises and false attacks.&nbsp; Iowans deserve better. As president, Mitt Romney will strengthen middle-class families in the heartland, create jobs, and turn our economy around." &mdash; Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Today, President Obama Blamed Paul Ryan For Washington's Failure To Pass Disaster Relief For Those Struggling From The Drought:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama, On Paul Ryan's Record On Disaster Relief: "He Is One Of The Leaders In Congress Standing In The Way. ... We've Got To Put Politics Aside When It Comes To Doing The Right Thing..."</b>&nbsp; OBAMA: "Now, before I get started, I just want to say a few words about the drought because it's had such an impact on this state and all across the country. ... The best way to help these states is for the folks in Congress to pass a farm bill that not only helps farmers and ranchers respond to natural disasters but also makes the necessary reforms and gives farmers and ranchers some long-term certainty. Unfortunately, right now too many members of congress are blocking the farm bill from becoming law. I am told that Governor Romney's new running mate Paul Ryan, might be around Iowa in the next few days. And he is one of the leaders in Congress standing in the way. ... We've got to put politics aside when it comes to doing the right thing for rural America and for Iowa."
