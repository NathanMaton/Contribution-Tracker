[And] Make Sure We Don't Pass Our Burdens, Our Debt" On To Our Children.</b> ROMNEY: "I've laid out with my economic plan, proposals that preserve economic freedom, create growth, will provide jobs for you as you come out of college and will make sure we don't pass our burdens, our debt, on to you. That really is at the heart of what my party is about. Making sure that we preserve this extraordinary unique nation in the history of the earth. This exceptional place which is imperiled by debt, by lack of a willingness to deal with the challenges we have, by stagnating growth and by an attack on economic freedom among our other freedoms that are being attacked. That's what it's about." (Mitt Romney, Remarks in Chicago, IL, 3/19/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Ann Romney: "Women Are ... Angry About The Legacy We're Going To Leave Their Children And Their Grandchildren."</b> ANN ROMNEY: "Let me tell you something else that's happening. Women are coming to me and saying, 'Will you please talk about deficit spending and budgets?' I'm loving that. Loving that. Women are angry. They're angry about the legacy we're going to leave their children and their grandchildren. And I'm going to tell them something. I've got somebody here that can fix it."

I'll Tell You Why. I Had To Spend The Surpluses."</b> "Confronted with projected deficits until fiscal 2007, senior GOP lawmakers are backing away from long-standing rhetoric about the government's duty to live within its means. 'I came to the House as a real deficit hawk, but I am no longer a deficit hawk,' said Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). 'I'll tell you why. I had to spend the surpluses. Deficits make it easier to say no.'"

Doesn't Matter To Me."</b> "Rick Santorum is coming under fire for saying that the unemployment rate and economic growth are secondary issues to that of freedom in his campaign ... [Santorum:] 'I don't care what the unemployment rate's going to be. Doesn't matter to me. My campaign doesn't hinge on unemployment rates and growth rates. It's something more foundational that's going on.'"

That may be because his own economic views aren't very conservative, and his tax plan has more in common with the president's tax philosophy than with libertarians' and Republicans' views."
