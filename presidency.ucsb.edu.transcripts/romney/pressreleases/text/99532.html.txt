Equally important, he is the one candidate who can be elected and the one best able to deal with the political realities in Washington, D.C., to accomplish what he and his party hope to accomplish if he's elected president of the United States.<p>...<p>Romney's term as Massachusetts governor was widely considered a success, however, and he demonstrated an ability to work with legislators on both sides of the aisle, a skill that would serve him well should he win the presidency in November and find himself dealing in the highly partisan atmosphere of the nation's capital next year.<p>He has the extensive, successful business experience that Republicans say the country needs in a president. He is the Washington outsider they say they want. And he has solid conservative, if not always firm, credentials.<p>...<p>Romney clearly is the GOP's best choice.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
