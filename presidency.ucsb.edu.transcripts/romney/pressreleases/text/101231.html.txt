But it's going to take more than a major economic speech to make Americans forget that President Obama has failed to deliver a major economic recovery. From Day One, Mitt Romney will help put Americans back to work and finally get our economy moving again." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today, President Obama Will Deliver A Major Economic Speech To "Hit A Reset Button" On His Campaign:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Will Deliver A Major Economic Speech To Effectively "Hit A Reset Button On His Re-Election Campaign." </b>"President Obama will use a speech in Ohio today effectively to hit a reset button on his re-election campaign, following a stretch of bad economic news and messaging missteps that have shaken Democrats' confidence and caused some allies to sound the alarm. At a community college outside Cleveland, Obama will seek to frame the economic debate with presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney, casting the November election as a stark choice rather than a referendum on his record."

In an economic speech on Thursday that could set the tone for months of campaigning, Obama is not likely to unveil new ideas to boost the economy and create new jobs, according to Democrats familiar with the preparations for the address."
