   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Romney for President Policy Director Lanhee Chen today made the following statement on a report from the Tax Policy Center:<p>"This is just another biased study from a former Obama staffer that ignores critical parts of Governor Romney's tax reform program, which will help the middle class and promote faster economic growth. The study analyzes only half of Governor Romney's tax program, ignoring the reforms that would make America's corporations more competitive by moving from the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world to one that is comparable to our trading partners. And the study ignores the positive benefits to economic growth from both the corporate tax plan and the deficit reduction called for in the Romney plan. These glaring gaps invalidate the report's conclusions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, President Obama and his allies are simply trying to distract attention from his failed record on the economy.&nbsp; And now, President Obama is doubling down on those failed policies by pushing for $2 trillion in tax increases on working Americans and job creators.&nbsp; The American people know better than to fall for these distractions."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
