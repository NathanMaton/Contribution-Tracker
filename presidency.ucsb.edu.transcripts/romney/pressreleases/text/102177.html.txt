After claiming yesterday 'the middle class is coming back,' the Vice President is now claiming that 'Detroit is getting back up.' But after nearly four years, middle-class families are struggling with lower income, fewer jobs, and increasing unemployment. The Romney-Ryan plan will provide 12 million new jobs, higher take-home pay and a brighter future for the middle class." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman <h4><b>Today In Michigan, Vice President Biden Claimed "Detroit Is Getting Back Up!":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Vice President Biden, Today: "Detroit Is Getting Back Up!" </b>"And guess what, Detroit is getting back up!
