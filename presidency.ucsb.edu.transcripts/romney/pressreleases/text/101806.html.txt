"He has done important work for the Veterans of Foreign Wars and on behalf of the security of our great nation. His service reminds of us of the courage of all our brave men and women in uniform. They've always answered the call of duty when it comes to protecting the liberties we hold dear. As president, I would be committed to keeping America strong both economically and militarily."<p>Announcing his endorsement, DeNoyer said, "At the Veterans of Foreign Wars' 113th National Convention in Reno, NV on July 24th, while serving as Commander-in-Chief, it was my distinct honor to introduce Governor Mitt Romney. I found the Governor most impressive. His proposals to restore our economic and military strength, while reasserting our moral strength abroad, are what this country desperately needs right now. This is not the time to shirk from our role as leader of the free world, nor is it the time to deal drastic cuts to our military. There are still those who would do us harm, and we must be ever vigilant against those threats. I am confident that Mitt Romney is the man to meet that challenge." &nbsp;<h4><b>Background On Richard DeNoyer: </b></h4><p><b>Richard L.
