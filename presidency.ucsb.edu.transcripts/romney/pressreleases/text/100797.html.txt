Too many Americans are struggling to find good jobs and make ends meet, and President Obama hasn't delivered for them. Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth tax policies, lower rates across the board, and press for a fairer, flatter, simpler tax code that will get our economy growing again." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Next Year, President Obama Will Impose "One Of The Biggest Tax Increases In History," Which Will Hit Many Small Business Owners:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"[President Obama] Is Setting Up The U.S. Economy For One Of The Biggest Tax Increases In History In 2013."</b> "President Obama unveiled part two of his American Jobs Act on Monday, and it turns out to be another permanent increase in taxes to pay for more spending and another temporary tax cut. No surprise there. What might surprise Americans, however, is how the President is setting up the U.S. economy for one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2013."

It would thus favor big corporations at the expense of smaller businesses that file as individuals and would see their marginal rate rise to 41% or more under Mr. Obama's plan to raise individual tax rates."
