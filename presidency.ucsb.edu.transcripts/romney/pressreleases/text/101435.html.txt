   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"As the failures of his presidency become more evident, Barack Obama has resorted to the tactics of a typical politician &mdash; dishonest and totally unsubstantiated attacks meant to distract from his own record by smearing the reputation of his opponent. President Obama once promised to be a different kind of politician. He promised not to engage in divisive attacks, and he promised to tell us the truth. As with so many of his unfulfilled promises, President Obama has let us down." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<p><b><i>To View The New Romney For President Ad, "No Evidence," Click Here: </i></b><a href="truth" target="_blank"><b><i>http://www.mittromney.com/truth</i></b></a><h4><b>A Slew Of Third-Party Fact Checks Have Found President Obama's Attacks "Outsource The Truth" And Are "Misleading, Unfair And Untrue":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>KCNC-TV In Denver, Colorado: "Problem Is: These Ads Don't Bear That Out."</b> SHAUN BOYD, KCNC-TV (CBS-DENVER): "The Obama campaign is going all out with its latest line of attack.

BOYD: "Bottom line, jobs are the top issue this election, and many voters are worried about the loss of American jobs to overseas companies, which is why the Obama campaign is spending millions of dollars to convince us Mitt Romney is part of the problem.
