We can either stay on the current path that we are on, a nation in debt, a nation in doubt, a nation in despair, a nation with high unemployment, where we are giving our children a diminished future or we can change this thing and get this country back on the right track. Now, historians often point to the key characteristics of a great leader, of a statesman, of the kind of leaders that have changed things around. A person must have a bedrock of principles, a moral compass, a vision for their country and an ability to put that vision into place. The man who best embodies those things, the man who has the experience to be that kind of leader we need at this moment is the man standing next to me. His name is Mitt Romney, and he is going to be the next President of the United States. You know why? We know who we are. We know what we believe in. We know the principles that built this country and we are going to reapply those principles and get this country back on the right track and leave our kids a better future."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
