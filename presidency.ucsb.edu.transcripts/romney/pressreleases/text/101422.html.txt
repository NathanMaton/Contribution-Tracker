BOB MCDONNELL: </b>"And you know, this sequestration bill that was put in place...last year was one that nobody really thought was going to go into effect, and, unfortunately,&nbsp;with the failure in Congress and no leadership from the White House, they put $600 billion of defense spending at risk. Even Secretary Panetta said it's a bad idea. So, I'm worried not only about jobs in Virginia, but I'm worried about the security of the United States of America. They can't wait until the lame duck session. They need to act, I think, now,&nbsp;Candy, to try to address this because defense contractors might have to send out warning notices in the next couple of months to hundreds of thousands of employees, saying you might not have a job. So, I think the President needs to lead on this, get Congress back, and do something about sequestration. Look, we need to cut spending. We're $16 trillion in debt, $5 trillion more because of the President's lack of leadership, but we can't do it this way and sacrifice the United States military."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
