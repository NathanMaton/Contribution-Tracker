   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama is the first president in history to openly campaign for re-election on a platform of higher taxes. He has already raised taxes on millions of Americans, but he won't stop there. He wants to raise taxes on millions more by taxing small businesses and job creators. We appreciate the Obama campaign reinforcing Mitt Romney's platform of lowering tax rates across the board in order to jumpstart this bad Obama economy." &mdash;Gail Gitcho, Romney Campaign Communications Director<h4><b>This Week, President Obama's Allies Will Be Campaigning On Their Favorite Subject &mdash; Raising Taxes:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Today, The Obama Campaign Will Hold A Conference Call On President Obama's Plans To Raise Taxes. </b>"In advance of the Senate vote on the Buffett Rule, Senator Dick Durbin, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin, and Campaign Manager Jim Messina will hold a conference call today highlighting the President's call for tax fairness and Governor Romney's opposition to it."

No surprise there. What might surprise Americans, however, is how the President is setting up the U.S. economy for one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2013."

That would raise the highest individual income tax rate to about 42%, including deduction phaseouts, from 35% today. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation found in 2009 that $437 billion of business income would be taxed at higher tax rates under the Obama plan. And since some 4.5 million small-business owners file their annual tax returns as subchapter S firms under the individual tax code, this tax increase would often apply to the same people who Mr. Obama is targeting with his new tax credits."
