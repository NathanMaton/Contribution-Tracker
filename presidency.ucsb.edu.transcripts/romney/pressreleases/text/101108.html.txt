Instead of making health care more affordable and accessible, Obamacare has caused premiums to rise and has jeopardized the health care plans of millions of Americans. On Day One, Mitt Romney will begin the process of ending Obamacare and replacing it with reforms that emphasize market competition and patient choice." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<p align="center"><b>DAY ONE OF A SECOND OBAMA TERM: NEW OBAMACARE TAXES & STIFLED GROWTH</b><h4><b>Starting In 2013, Obamacare Will Hit The Economy With The Largest Tax Hike In Nearly Two Decades:</b></h4><p><b>Obamacare Contained "The Largest Tax Increase Since 1993." </b>"Keep in mind that Mr. Obama has already signed the largest tax increase since 1993.

Several of the Affordable Care Act's worst tax increases kick in too, such as the new excise tax on medical devices. The 2.3% levy applies to the sale of everything from cardiac defibrillators to artificial joints to MRI scanners. The device tax is supposed to raise $28.5 billion from 2013 to 2022, and it is especially harmful because it applies to gross sales, not profits."

For first time, the bill also applies Medicare's 2.9% payroll tax rate to investment income, including dividends, interest income and capital gains. Added to the 0.9% payroll surcharge, that means a 3.8-percentage point tax hike on 'the rich.' Oh, and these new taxes aren't indexed for inflation, so many middle-class families will soon be considered rich and pay the surcharge as their incomes rise past $250,000 due to tax-bracket creep.

Independent health care experts say the law has caused some insurance premiums to rise. As we wrote in October, the new law has caused about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored family plans because of requirements for increased benefits. Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made - that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.'"
