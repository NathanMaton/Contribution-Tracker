To suggest that four more years of Barack Obama is better than electing Mitt Romney is ridiculous and demonstrates his lack of commitment to conservative principles."<p>Republicans need to unite around our nominee in order to undo the damage caused by President Obama's failed policies and restore America's promise. Senator Santorum is not only damaging himself with his ill-advised comments, he's damaging the conservative movement. In the future, he should think before he speaks."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
