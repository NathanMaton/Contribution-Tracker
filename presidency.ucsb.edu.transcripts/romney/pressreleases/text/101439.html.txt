"This strong showing of support shows that my message of putting jobs first is resonating with voters from Pittsburg to Nashua. These leaders will help ensure that we have the resources to compete with President Obama's campaign, which will stop at nothing to distract from the President's failed record."<p>"Throughout the last four years, our country has seen the growth of government and the policies that have hindered our fragile recovery," said New Hampshire Finance State Chair Beverly Bruce. "Granite Staters are looking for a change that will spur economic growth and ensure prosperity for all Americans. Mitt Romney is that candidate and I am proud to stand with him."<h4><b>Mitt Romney's New Hampshire Finance State Chair:</b></h4><p>Beverly Bruce, Tuftonboro<h4><b>New Hampshire Finance Committee </b></h4><p>Representative Chris Ahlgren, Wolfeboro<br>Juliana Bergeron, Keene<br>Bill Binnie, Rye<br>State Senator Jeb Bradley, Wolfeboro<br>Marc Bourgeois, Tilton<br>Steve Duprey, Concord<br>Jim Foley, Derry<br>Jackie Eastwood, Durham<br>Lou and Mary Ann Gargiulo, Hampton Falls<br>Senator Judd and Kathy Gregg, Rye<br>Walt and Judy Havenstein, Alton<br>Cliff Hurst, Manchester<br>Geordy Hutchinson, Wolfeboro<br>Michael Kaufman, Bedford<br>Doug Magee, Wolfeboro<br>Sean Mahoney, Portsmouth<br>Michael McClurken, Durham<br>Jim Merrill, Manchester<br>Tom Rath, Concord<br>Judi Rhines, Concord<br>Ambassador Gregory Slayton, Hanover<br>Ambassador Paul and Renee Speltz, Center Harbor<br>Governor John Sununu, Hampton Falls<br>Paul Zimmerman, Wolfeboro Falls<br>Chris Wolfe, Derry</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
