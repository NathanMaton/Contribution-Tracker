As they hire, businesses should not have to worry that a politicized federal agency will rewrite the rules of the employment game without warning and without regard for the law.<ul><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Appoint to the NLRB experienced individuals with respect for the rule of law</li><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Amend NLRA to explicitly protect the right of business owners to allocate their capital as they see fit</li><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Reverse executive orders issued by President Obama that tilt the playing field toward organized labor</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Free Choice</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Mitt Romney believes in the right of workers to join a union or to not join a union. To exercise that right freely, workers must have access to all the relevant facts they need to make an informed decision. This means hearing from both the union about the potential benefits and from management about potential costs. This also means being able to act on that decision in the privacy of the ballot booth.<ul><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Amend NLRA to guarantee the secret ballot in every union certification election</li><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Amend NLRA to guarantee that all pre-election campaigns last at least one month</li><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Support states in pursuing Right-to-Work laws</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Free Speech</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;">As matters currently stand, unions can take money directly from the paychecks of American workers and spend it on politicking&mdash;each election cycle, unions spend hundreds of millions of dollars. In non-Right-to-Work states, employees have little choice but to watch their money go toward such expenditures, even if they do not support the union and its political agenda. The result is the creation of an enormously powerful interest group whose influence is disproportionate to its actual support and whose priorities are fundamentally misaligned with those of businesses and workers&mdash;and thus with the needs of the economy.<ul><li style="margin-left: 80px; ">Prohibit the use for political purposes of funds automatically deducted from worker paychecks</li></ul><p></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
