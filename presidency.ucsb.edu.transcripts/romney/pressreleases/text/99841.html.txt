   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Vermont.<p>"My growing support in Vermont is a sign that my pro-growth message is resonating in the state," said Mitt Romney. "Voters in Vermont and across the country are tired of the broken promises from Washington. I spent my life outside Washington, working in the private sector, and know what it will take to turn around our economy. I look forward to working with these fine leaders from Vermont to defeat President Obama and bring change to the broken Washington system."<p>"Vermont voters are looking for someone to go to Washington, turn around our economy and fix the fiscal mess that Washington politicians have created," said former Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. "Mitt Romney is the one candidate with the track record and economic plan to do just that. With Mitt Romney as president, Vermont voters can be confident that we will have more jobs, smaller government and less debt."<h4><b>Vermont Elected Officials and Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p>Former Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie<br>State Senator Joe Benning<br>State Senator Richard Westman<br>Former Speaker of the House Walter Freed<br>National Committeeman George Schiavone<br>National Committeewoman Susie Hudson<br>Former Vermont Republican Party Chairwoman Pat McDonald<h4><b>Vermont Elected Officials and Leaders Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p>State Auditor Tom Salmon<br>Senate Minority Leader William Doyle<br>State Senator Randy Brock<br>State Senator Peg Flory<br>State Senator Vince Illuzzi<br>State Senator Kevin Mullin<br>State Representative and Former Vermont Republican Party Chairman Joe Acinapura<br>State Representative Gregory Clark<br>State Representative Howard Crawford<br>State Representative Dustin Degree<br>State Representative Eileen Dickinson<br>State Representative Peter Fagan<br>State Representative Mike Hebert<br>State Representative Robert Helm<br>State Representative Robert Lewis<br>State Representative Linda Myers<br>State Representative Gerald Reis<br>State Representative Vicki Strong<br>Wendy Wilton; Former State Senator and Rutland City Treasurer<br>Steve Larabee; Former State Representative and former Vermont Republican Party Chairman<br>Thomas Lauzon; Barre Mayor<br>Chris Roy; Former Republican Candidate for Secretary of State<br>Tim Haywood; Chief of Staff to former Governor Jim Douglas<br>Jim Barnett; Former Vermont Republican Party Chairman<br>Jack Lindley; Vermont Republican Party Chairman<br>Allen Martin; Former Vermont Republican Party Chairman<br>Bradford Broyles; Rutland County Republican Chair<br>Ken Copp; Essex County Republican Chair<br>Dr. Bill Minsinger; Orange County Republican Chair<br>Dan Riley; Bennington County Republican Chair<br>Hugh Tallman; Lamoille County Republican Chair<br>Leo Valliere; Washington County Republican Chair and former State Representative<br>Chuck Wilton; Rutland County Republican Finance Chair<br>Lenny Barclay; Londonderry Town Republican Chair<br>Don Bostic; Saint Johnsbury Town GOP Chair and former State Representative<br>Del Cook; Brandon Town Republican Chair<br>Lawrence Daley; Peru Town Republican Chair<br>Joe DeFreitas; Bethel Town Republican Chair<br>Dawn Hill-Fleury; Essex Town Republican Chair<br>Cliff King; East Montpelier Town Republican Chair<br>Bruce Lonergan; Bennington Town Republican Chair<br>Eric Osgood; Johnson Town Republican Chair<br>Mike Lannon; Rutland City Republican Chair<br>Don Trachte; Sandgate Town GOP Chair<br>Patricia Morale; Secretary of the Pittsford Town Republican Party<br>John Kleinhans; Former Vermont College Republican President<br>Marilyn Childs; State Central Committee<br>Ron Meroli; State Central Committee<br>Bob and Pat Nowak; State Central Committee<br>Ann Valliere; State Central Committee<br>John and Carol Wu; State Central Committee<br>Lynn Lindley; Montpelier City Committee<br>J.
