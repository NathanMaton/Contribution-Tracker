This is just another example of President Obama's failed record, which he'll be desperate to hide from voters this November." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>In 2008, Candidate Obama Campaigned On A Pledge To "Change The Culture In Washington" So That "Special Interests Aren't Driving The Process":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In 2008: "We're Going To Have To Change The Culture In Washington So That Lobbyists And Special Interests Aren't Driving The Process."</b> (Sen.

Many of the president's biggest donors, while not lobbyists, took lobbyists with them to the White House, while others performed essentially the same function on their visits."

Among donors who gave $30,000 or less, about 20 percent visited the White House, according to a New York Times analysis that matched names in the visitor logs with donor records. But among those who donated $100,000 or more, the figure rises to about 75 percent. Approximately two-thirds of the president's top fund-raisers in the 2008 campaign visited the White House at least once, some of them numerous times."
