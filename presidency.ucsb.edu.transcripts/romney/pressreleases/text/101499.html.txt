We had the consumer index drop to the lowest level. But there were questions that Governor Romney wanted to address and make sure people understood that he's not a felon. That's how, that's what this campaign on the Obama side was reduced to. And it's sad to see, and I think Americans now know, you've got these baseless charges on moving jobs overseas, which independent fact checkers have said are not true, they're indeed a lie. And then a completely reckless and unfounded allegation of criminal activity, and so it's sad to see. We now know that this president will say or do anything to keep the highest office in the land, even if it means demeaning the highest office in the land."&nbsp;</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
