Thanks to his experience as governor and in the private sector, Mitt Romney is clearly the best prepared candidate to help put America back on a path to economic prosperity.<p>"In a few weeks, Missourians will make their choice during our state caucuses. I'm proud to support Governor Romney's bold agenda to jumpstart our nation's economy, and I urge my fellow Missourians who are looking for a fiscally responsible leader to support his candidacy for president."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
