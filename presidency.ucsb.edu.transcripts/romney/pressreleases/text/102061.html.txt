But after four years, it's clear the President just hasn't lived up to his promises. Jobs have declined, incomes have plummeted, and household costs are skyrocketing. Mitt Romney will get our country back on track by creating 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago, Candidate Obama Criticized An Economy "In Turmoil" With More Americans Out Of Work And Bills That Are "Beyond Reach":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, At The 2008 Democratic Convention: "Our Economy Is In Turmoil ...
