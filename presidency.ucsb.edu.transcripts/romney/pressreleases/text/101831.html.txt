Business owners &mdash; like all Americans &mdash; realize the only way to get America's economy back on track is to elect a president who understands hard work and entrepreneurship build businesses, not government programs." &mdash; Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Small-Business Owners Continue To Weigh In On President Obama's Out-Of-Touch Claim That Americans Didn't Build Their Businesses:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Michael Duffy, The President Of Per Mar Security Services In Iowa, Said President Obama's Comments "Reveal A View Of The Economy That Is Fundamentally At Odds With Most Americans." </b>"But there is another context that is equally if not more important than the one surrounding Obama's comments in Roanoke, Va. It is the greater context of this president's actions and words over the last several months and indeed his entire presidency. They reveal a view of the economy that is fundamentally at odds with most Americans, and they help to explain why the president has had so much difficulty turning around the economy."

'If you got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen,' — which really hurt our feelings,' Yang said."
