There's no question about energy having gotten more expensive under this president, and part of that is because of his policies. He's cut back on the number of licenses by 50 percent given to drillers in public lands. His policies have made it harder for us to take advantage of our energy resources. Right here in Virginia, the idea that you have powerful energy right off your coast, that you could be creating good jobs right here in Virginia and providing resources at reasonable cost to the people of America, that's been lost by a president who said no. The Department of Interior says they're studying it. Studying it. Didn't study very long to get the money, $500 million, to Solyndra, did they? They got that out in a big hurry."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
