We should know that we're not going to turn around this economy by replacing one former senator with zero job-creating experience with another senator with zero job-creating experience." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Spokesperson<h4><b>Senator Santorum's Economic Plan?

It is at bottom a provincial viewpoint that some jobs are better than others. ... Santorum's plan reflects the perspective of a Pennsylvania senator who saw jobs decline in one sector in his state. It's the same viewpoint that caused him to vote against NAFTA and free trade deals and side with Big Labor. It might be temporarily good for Pennsylvania, but it's rotten economic policy."

Such schemes, he says, are 'completely at odds with tax reform.'"

Fiscal Conservatism Was "Not [His] Strong Suit":</b></h4><p><b>Santorum Has Admitted He Is "No Longer A Deficit Hawk ... I'll Tell You Why.</b> I Had To Spend The Surpluses." "Confronted with projected deficits until fiscal 2007, senior GOP lawmakers are backing away from long-standing rhetoric about the government's duty to live within its means. 'I came to the House as a real deficit hawk, but I am no longer a deficit hawk,' said Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). 'I'll tell you why. I had to spend the surpluses. Deficits make it easier to say no.'"
