"Dan shares my values of instituting pro-growth policies like lowering taxes and scaling back the size of government. To be successful in restoring America's promise, we need to spread this same message across Alaska. I know Dan's support will go a long way in doing just that."<p>"Conservatives are looking for a proven leader who can turn this country around. It is simply not enough to talk about conservative principles, our candidate must be ready to put them into practice," said Mayor Sullivan. "For me, the choice is clear. Mitt Romney spent his life as a conservative businessman—balancing budgets, creating jobs, and turning around troubled companies. But not only does he have the experience to empower small businesses and rebuild the middle class, he also has a detailed economic plan that will create more jobs, cut spending, and reduce the size of government. He is the bold leader we need in the White House and that's why I'm proud to join his team."<p>"Romney's letter to Alaskans shows he understands our challenges and our opportunity to help America &mdash; from the value of our strategic location in the world to the value of our resources," Sullivan said.&nbsp; "I plan to vote for Mitt in Tuesday's Republican Presidential Preference Poll."<p><b>Background On Dan Sullivan:</b><p>Dan Sullivan has served as the Mayor of Anchorage, Alaska since 2009.
