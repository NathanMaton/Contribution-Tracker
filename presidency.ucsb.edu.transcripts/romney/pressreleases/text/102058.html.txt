   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Barack Obama campaigned on a pledge to protect the 'American promise' for middle-class families. But President Obama's economic policies have only made life more difficult. Fewer people are working, unemployment remains unacceptably high, and America's security and jobs are threatened by the President's devastating defense cuts. As president, Mitt Romney will reverse this disastrous course by implementing policies that create 12 million new jobs and a safer and more prosperous future for the next generation." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago Today, Barack Obama Claimed The "Fundamental American Promise" Was At Risk:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, Four Years Ago Today: "That Fundamental American Promise Is At Risk. ...

More Americans are out of work, and have mortgages they can't pay, and cars they can't afford to drive, and wonder how they'll ever afford to retire."

They need us to solve this housing crisis, and end these tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas, and give real tax relief to middle class families. That's what I'll do as President."
