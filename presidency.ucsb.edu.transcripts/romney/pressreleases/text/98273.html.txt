Over parts of five decades in Washington, Speaker Gingrich has consistently promoted an active, expansive role for government. Conservatives know the importance of reforming the federal government and cutting spending, and it is clear they cannot count on Newt Gingrich to be a friend to their cause." &mdash;Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director<h4><b>First In May, Then Again Last Month, Gingrich Attacked Congressman Paul Ryan's Plan As "Right-Wing Social Engineering"</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Gingrich: "I Don't Think Right-Wing Social Engineering Is Any More Desirable Than Left-Wing Social Engineering."</b> GINGRICH: "I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering.

I think we need a national conversation to get to a better Medicare system with more choices for seniors."
