   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"For nearly four years, President Obama has promised to stop Washington's reckless spending habits. But whether it was his trillion-dollar stimulus package or other budget-busting policies, the Obama Administration has repeatedly failed to live up to the President's own promises. Governor Romney will finally end Washington's spending addiction and stop passing our financial burdens to the next generation." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>For The Last Three-And-A-Half Years, Vice President Biden Has Led President Obama's So-Called "Oversight Effort" To Stop Wasteful Spending:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Appointed Vice President Biden To "Lead A Tough, Unprecedented Oversight Effort" Over Stimulus Spending "Because Nobody Messes With Joe." </b>OBAMA: "And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right. That is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort – because nobody messes with Joe. I have told each member of my Cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend."

If You're Misusing Taxpayer Money, You'll Have To Answer To Him." </b>OBAMA: "To you, he's Mr. Vice President, but around the White House, we call him the Sheriff -- (laughter) -- because if you're misusing taxpayer money, you'll have to answer to him."

A Trillion-Dollar Stimulus Packed With Wasteful Projects:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Vice President Biden, Shortly After President Obama Appointed Him "Sheriff" Joe Biden: "We Know Some Of This Money Is Going To Be Wasted." </b>"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged on Tuesday that some waste is inevitable in the spending of a $787 billion economic stimulus package, in a characteristically blunt assessment. 'We know some of this money is going to be wasted,' Biden said during a roundtable discussion in New York with business leaders aimed at promoting the two-year stimulus plan."

In written testimony prepared for delivery to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today, Inspector General Gregory Friedman said the investigations have involved 'various schemes, including the submission of false information, claims for unallowable or unauthorized expenses, and other improper uses of Recovery Act funds.'"

Jones and Rothschild uncovered was that the top-down stimulus was poorly targeted. In one redolent example, a federal contractor said he was told to use smaller, nonstandard tiles that are harder and more expensive to install in order to increase the cost of the project. That way, the government could claim the money was moving out the door faster. The famous Milton Friedman line about government ordering people to dig with spoons to employ more people comes to mind."

If anything, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act &mdash; passed along party lines, with the aid of all sorts of side deals and kickbacks to woo holdout lawmakers &mdash; ultimately might have delayed and extended the pain of the recession by providing only short-term and inefficient fixes to a much-larger economic problem, while significantly increasing the nation's burden of debt."
