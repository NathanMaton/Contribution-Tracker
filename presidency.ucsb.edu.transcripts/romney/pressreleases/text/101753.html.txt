But no amount of showmanship can paper over the differences between these two presidents. Americans deserve a president willing to run on his own record, not the record he wishes he had." &mdash; Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Today, The Obama Campaign Will Announce That President Clinton Will Deliver A Speech At The Democratic National Convention:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Former President Clinton Will Deliver A Prime-Time Speech At The 2012 Democratic National Convention. </b>"Former President Bill Clinton is set to play a central part in the Democratic convention, aides said, and will formally place President Obama's name into nomination by delivering a prime-time speech designed to present a forceful economic argument for why Mr. Obama deserves to win a second term."

CLINTON: "Well ..."&nbsp; ROSE: "They are rolling the dice about America if they don't choose the person who has had the kind of experience you are talking about." CLINTON: "It's less predictable, isn't it? I mean, when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the Senate before he started running, and he will have been a senator longer by the time he is inaugurated, but essentially once you start running for president full time, you don't have time to do much else."
