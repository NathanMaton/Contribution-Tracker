Massachusetts voters are looking for someone to go to Washington to clean up the mess created by Washington politicians. Mitt Romney is a Washington outsider who spent his career in the private sector &mdash; the other candidates in the race are creatures of Washington and can't be expected to clean up the mess they created. He has the experience and leadership record that will be needed to turn around our economy, shrink government, and put an end to our massive debt and deficits. This Tuesday, I urge all Massachusetts Republicans who want to defeat President Obama and bring real change to Washington to vote for Mitt Romney."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
