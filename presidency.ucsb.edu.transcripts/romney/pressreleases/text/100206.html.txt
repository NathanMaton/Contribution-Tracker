Mitt Romney has accomplished many things in his life, but it's his experience in business that truly makes him stand out in this field. Here in Missouri, where a lot of people are hurting, we sorely need the kind of change that he alone is capable of bringing to Washington. We need a conservative businessman in the White House. Republican voters here clearly agree."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
