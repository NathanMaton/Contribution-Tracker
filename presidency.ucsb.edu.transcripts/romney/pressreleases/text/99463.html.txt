Rick Snyder endorsed Mitt Romney for president at a chamber of commerce luncheon here today.<p>"The job is not getting done, and we need the leadership in Washington to get that job done, and to do that, you need the right people leading the charge. And we have a person in Governor Romney who has that background," Snyder said. "He has a great combination of private sector experience, of knowing what it takes to create a job, and how difficult that is, how to succeed in the private sector. He also brings that experience of being the chief executive of a state, of understanding what it's to be in the public sector. And to be successful in running a state. That's the experience we need in Washington."<p>...<p>Today, he adopted one of Romney's favorite targets in giving his endorsement: the lack of business understanding in Washington, D.C.<p>"I was amazed in government at how little understanding there is of business. It shocked me to see how many people in government had never spent any time in business," Snyder said. "And yet the economy, business, is what drives the revenues of government, and the well-being of our citizens. And yet they don't understand it."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
