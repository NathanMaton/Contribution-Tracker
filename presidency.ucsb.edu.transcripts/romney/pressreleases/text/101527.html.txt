But you wouldn't know it listening to President Obama, who has promised to double down on his failed health care policies in a second term. On Day One, Mitt Romney will take action to repeal and replace Obamacare to help turn our economy around." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>The Obama Economy Is Upside Down With Health Care Premiums That Are Continuing To Rise:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Under President Obama, Family Health Care Premiums Have Increased $2,393 During President Obama's First Three Years In Office.</b> Average annual family premiums have increased from $12,680 in 2008 to $15,073 in 2011.

Giving families and businesses relief was a big part of Obama's sales pitch for health care reform. ... But no matter what happens with the law, the line on that graph isn't going to go down."

Independent health care experts say the law has caused some insurance premiums to rise. As we wrote in October, the new law has caused about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored family plans because of requirements for increased benefits. Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made - that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.'"

And in the worst-case scenario, it could be as many as 20 million."
