   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Governor Mary Fallin&nbsp;today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:<p>"Having worked with Paul Ryan in Congress, I know he is a smart, committed advocate for the kind of small government, pro-growth policies that are going to create more jobs and get this country back on track. He's also a genuinely nice person with a great family and a wonderful wife from Madill, Oklahoma. He will make a great running mate, and continue to be an effective voice for the principles of limited government and free markets that make America great. I applaud Mitt Romney for selecting Paul, and I look forward to doing everything I can to support the Romney/Ryan ticket."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
