Romney also announced that House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, Senate Minority Leader John McKinney and former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley will chair his Steering Committee in the state. <p>"I am proud to announce my supporters in Connecticut," said Mitt Romney. "Connecticut voters want a president with a record of job creation, cutting spending, and keeping taxes low. That is why I am running for President. These leaders will help me as I reach out to voters in Connecticut spreading this pro-growth message and working to bring jobs back to the state and the country." <p>Announcing his support, House Minority Leader Larry Cafero said, "Connecticut voters are looking for someone who has experience working in the real economy. After three years of failed policies, it is clear that we need a candidate who will defeat President Obama and get America's fiscal house in order." <p>Senate Minority Leader John McKinney said, "With millions of Americans unemployed, is time for a president who will get people back to work. From his experience in the private sector, Mitt Romney understands what is required to create jobs. As Governor of Massachusetts, he balanced the budget without raising taxes. Washington needs this kind of leadership more than ever." <p><b>Connecticut Elected Officials and Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>Tom Foley; Former U.S. Ambassador</li> <li>Senate Minority Leader John McKinney</li> <li>House Minority Leader Larry Cafero</li> <li>Kevin O'Connor; Former Connecticut U.S. Attorney</li> <li>The Honorable Rob Simmons, Member of Congress, 2001-2007</li> <li>The Honorable Larry DeNardis, Member of Congress, 1980-1984 and Former President of the University of New Haven</li> <li>State Senator Toni Boucher</li> <li>State Senator Scott Frantz</li> <li>State Senator Rob Kane</li> <li>State Senator Michael McLachlan</li> <li>State Senator Kevin Witkos</li> <li>Dan Debicella; Former State Senator</li> <li>Judith Freedman; Former State Senator</li> <li>Mark Nielsen; Former State Senator</li> <li>State Representative Mike Alberts</li> <li>State Representative Chris Coutu</li> <li>State Representative Janice Giegler</li> <li>State Representative John Hetherington</li> <li>State Representative Jason Perillo</li> <li>State Representative David Scribner</li> <li>State Representative Terrie Wood</li> <li>John Stripp; Former State Representative</li> <li>Julia Wasserman; Former State Representative</li> <li>Mark Boughton; Mayor of Danbury</li> <li>Tim Stewart; Mayor of New Britain</li> <li>Dick Moccia; Mayor of Norwalk</li> <li>Ryan Bingham; Mayor of Torrington</li> <li>Jayme Stevenson; Selectman for Darien</li> <li>Jerry Nielsen; Selectman for Darien</li> <li>Laura Francis; First Selectman for Durham</li> <li>Michael Pace; First Selectman for Old Saybrook</li> <li>Tim Herbst; First Selectman of Trumbull</li> <li>Diane Generous; State Central Committee - Baltic</li> <li>Rich Tutunjian; State Central Committee - Barkhamsted</li> <li>Jennifer Harvey; State Central Committee - Bolton</li> <li>Bill Jenkins; State Central Committee - Chaplin</li> <li>Jonathan Gilman; State Central Committee - Gilman</li> <li>Jane Dauphinais; State Central Committee - Groton</li> <li>Alex Karsanidi; State Central Committee - Ridgefield</li> <li>Mike Botelho; Glastonbury Republican Town Committee, State Central Committee</li> <li>Jim Campbell; Greenwich Town Republican Chair</li> <li>Corey Brinson; Hartford Councilman</li> <li>John Pavia; Connecticut Republican Party Finance Committee Chairman</li> <li>Greg Butler; Senior Vice President and General Counsel Northeast Utilities</li> <li>Cindy Varricchio; Portland Town Republican Committee Chairman</li> <li>Ed Dadakis; Former Chairman Greenwich Republican Town Committee</li> <li>Mike Doyle; Former New London Town Republican Committee Chairman</li> <li>Jay Malcynsky; Attorney; Connecticut Director, Bush for President 2000</li> <li>Derek Phelps; Director, External Affairs for Updike, Kelly & Spellacy, P.C.</li> <li>Gary DeFilippo Former Commissioner, State Department of Motor Vehicles</li> <li>Dick Foley; Former Connecticut Republican Party Chairman</li> <li>John Miller; Former RNC National Committeeman</li> <li>George Gallo; Former Connecticut Republican Party Chair</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
