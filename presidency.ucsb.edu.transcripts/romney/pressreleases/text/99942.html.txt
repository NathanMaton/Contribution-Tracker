Beginning with Abraham Lincoln, no GOP candidate has ever been elected president without Ohio's electoral votes. In any Republican strategy to unseat President Barack Obama this November, Ohio is a must-win state.<br>...<p>Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is the only remaining Republican contender capable of that.<p>Romney, who turns 65 next week, served only a single term as governor, and by the standards of most serious presidential contenders, his political resume is short: two statewide campaigns and an unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination four years ago.<br>...<p>But Romney's private-sector success is also critical to his appeal. He understands how businesses and investors make decisions. He has had to make tough choices, trade short-term pain for long-term gain. A serious debate between Romney and Obama about the proper role and size of government would be healthy for a nation facing grave fiscal challenges.<p>None of Romney's GOP rivals seem capable of such engagement -- or of appealing to a broad range of voters.<br>...<p>The next president, regardless of party, will have to work in a Washington riven by partisan and ideological chasms.<br>...<p>In fact, it is Romney's real-world experiences -- in business, as a governor and as the executive who rescued the Salt Lake City Olympics -- that set him apart from the GOP field. They are what make him, by far, the best choice for Ohio Republicans.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
