(CNBC's "The Kudlow Report," 1/26/12)<p><b>Kudlow: </b>"It just sounds like the language of the left." (CNBC's "The Kudlow Report," 1/26/12)<p><b>Kudlow: </b>"But I think--you know, Speaker, I think that George W. Bush never used this hostile language to investment and business. Certainly Ronald Reagan never singled out investment funds and attacked them." (CNBC's "The Kudlow Report," 1/26/12)<p><b>Kudlow: </b>"Or is it just political expediency and opportunism where you're giving up your principles that I thought you and I shared?"

(CNBC's "The Kudlow Report," 1/26/12)<p><b>Kudlow: </b>"But when you use that language, you sound like, pardon the phrase, President Obama or the left wing of the Democratic Party. That's what's disappointed, Newt, that's what disappointed many of your conservative supporters during this campaign."
