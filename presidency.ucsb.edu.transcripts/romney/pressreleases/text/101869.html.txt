Jobless claims are up, unemployment is at a five-month high, and Americans are suffering from the worst economic recovery the country has ever had. Mitt Romney has a plan that will strengthen our middle class and finally get Americans back to work." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>This Morning, Obama Senior Adviser David Axelrod Tried To Re-Write History On President Obama's Failed "Recovery Summer":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>David Axelrod, On Whether He Had Claimed 2010 Would Be A "Recovery Summer": "Well, You Should Show Me The Tape Of Me Saying That." </b>WALLACE: "But David, didn't this White House badly misjudge this recovery? I remember in 2010, two summers ago, you and Vice President Biden were running around talking about recovery summer. That was the summer of 2010. And the fact is that your White House said that if you got the stimulus—the $800 billion dollars—that unemployment would stay under 8 percent. In fact, with the stimulus, unemployment has stayed over 8 percent for the last 42 months. That's three and a half years." AXELROD: "Chris, first of all. I wasn't around saying anything other than that we were going to have to be persistent—that it took years to get in this mess, it was going to take years to get out." WALLACE: "You talked about 'Recovery Summer' in 2010, sir." AXELROD: "Well, you should show me the tape of me saying that."

They made a cynical bet that if the President fails, they win. Democrats chose to act by tackling the crisis head-on. Just over a year later, the Recovery Act is putting millions of Americans to work and helping the economy grow again.
