While President Obama all but ignored his record over three and a half years in office, the American people won't. This November, they will hold him accountable for his broken promises and ineffective leadership." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today, President Obama Claimed "We Measure Prosperity" By "How Well The Typical Family Is Doing":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama, In Ohio: "We Measure Prosperity Not Just By Our Total GDP ... But How Well The Typical Family Is Doing..." </b>OBAMA: "We measure prosperity not just by our total GDP, not just by how many billionaires we produce, but how well the typical family is doing, whether they can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them. And we understand that in this country, people succeed when they have a chance to get a decent education and learn new skills and, by the way, so do the businesses that hire them or the companies that they start."

Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made - that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.'"
