Instead of meeting with his Jobs Council, he is busy holding fundraisers, playing golf and trying to tear down Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney will never be too busy to focus on jobs and the economy and it will be his top priority as president." &mdash; Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokeswoman<h4><b>President Obama Has Promised To Help The Middle Class, But His Policies Have Left Middle-Class Families Struggling: </b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>More Than Twenty-Three Million Americans Are Unemployed, Underemployed, Or Have Stopped Looking For Work.</b>&nbsp;(Bureau Of Labor Statistics,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">www.bls.gov</a>, 7/7/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"The Ranks Of America's Poor Are On Track To Climb To Levels Unseen In Nearly Half A Century..." </b>"The ranks of America's poor are on track to climb to levels unseen in nearly half a century, erasing gains from the war on poverty in the 1960s amid a weak economy and fraying government safety net."
