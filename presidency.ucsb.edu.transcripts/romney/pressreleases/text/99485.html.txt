Our kids are served best when these crucial decisions are made at the local level."<p>Announcing his support, Douglas County School District Board of Education President John Carson said, "We are very proud to be supporting Mitt Romney. He is committed to making our education system more effective by reducing needless federal intrusion, empowering local officials, and promoting choice and competition. He is also a proven leader who has shown time and again that he can turn around troubled enterprises. That is exactly what the bureaucratic U.S. Department of Education needs today. I look forward to having a President Romney in the White House and unleashing our schools and our students to achieve their full potential."<p><b>Members of the Douglas County Board of Education:</b><p>John Carson &mdash; President<p>Dan Gerken &mdash; Vice President<p>Doug Benevento &mdash; Director<p>Meghann Silverthorn &mdash; Director<p>Kevin P.
