The results of these policies are clear – businesses are afraid to hire again and millions of Americans are still struggling for work. On day one, Mitt Romney will usher in pro-growth policies that help give businesses the confidence they need to begin hiring again." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4 align="center"><b>PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RECORD OF BROKEN PROMISES ON FREE ENTERPRISE</b></h4><h4><b>Candidate Obama Promised To Help People "Take A Risk And Start A New Business" – But New Business Startups Are Down On His Watch:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In Denver In 2008: "We Measure The Strength Of Our Economy ...
