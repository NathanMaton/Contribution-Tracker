   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"There are two proposals on the table for addressing the nation's entitlement crisis. Mitt Romney &mdash; along with a bipartisan group of leaders &mdash; has offered a solution that would introduce competition and choice into Medicare, control costs, and strengthen the program for future generations. President Obama has cut $500 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare and created an unaccountable board with rationing power &mdash; all while America's debt is spiraling out of control and we continue to run trillion-dollar deficits.&nbsp;If President Obama's plan is to end Medicare as we know it, he should say so. If he has another plan, he should have the courage to put it forward.&nbsp;Until he explains his position and answers the following questions, he and his spokespeople are irrelevant to the national debate." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>ONE: Why Is President Obama Ending Medicare As We Know It By Allowing It To Go Bankrupt In Less Than 15 Years?</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>President Obama Has Failed To Propose "Meaningful Reforms In Entitlements."</b><b> </b>"His budget also proposes no meaningful reforms in entitlements, which are the fastest growing part of the budget and will grow even faster once ObamaCare really kicks in."
