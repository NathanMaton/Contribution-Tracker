Does timidity and weakness invite aggression on the part of other people? Absolutely. A strong America &mdash; a strong America is the best ally peace has ever known. This is a president with the spy drone being brought down, he says pretty please? A foreign policy based on pretty please? You got to be kidding. This is a president who fundamentally believes that this next century is the post-American century. Perhaps it's going to be the Chinese century? He is wrong. [It has to be] the American century. America has to lead the free world. And the free world has to lead the entire world. The right course under President Obama's plans is to shrink our military &mdash; thinking somehow if we appease or accommodate the tyrants of the world, that the world will be safer. He's wrong. The right course for America is to strengthen our economy, strengthen our values, our families, and our military. We need to rebuild the navy and go from nine ships a year to fifteen. We need to modernize our Air Force. We need 100,000 new additional troops in our military. We need to take care of our veterans in a way they deserve. It is time to recognize once again a strong military does not create war. A strong America prevents people from trying to test us around the world."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
