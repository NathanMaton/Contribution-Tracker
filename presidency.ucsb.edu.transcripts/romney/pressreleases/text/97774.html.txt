"With their help, I look forward to getting America back to work. Earning the support of Missouri voters will be critical in this campaign." <p>"Thanks to his experience in the private sector and as governor, I believe Mitt Romney is the best prepared to help get our nation's economy back on track," said U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.). "Missourians are tired of President Obama's costly economic policies, which have led to out-of-control spending, record federal debt, and fewer private sector jobs nationwide." <p>State Auditor Tom Schweich said, "I am proud to stand behind Mitt Romney in his campaign for president. His experience in the private sector makes him the best candidate in the race to turn around our economy. He will provide the much needed leadership in Washington to get Americans back to work and restore fiscal sanity in government." <p><b>Missouri Elected Officials And Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>Roy Blunt; U.S. Senator</li> <li>Jim Talent; Former U.S. Senator</li> <li>Tom Schweich; State Auditor </li> <li>Tom Dempsey; Senate Majority Leader </li> <li>Tim Jones; House Majority Leader </li> <li>Michael Gibbons; Former Senate President Pro Tempore </li> <li>Catherine Hanaway; Former Speaker of the State House</li> <li>Doug Russell; Former Missouri Republican Party Chairman</li> <li>Mike Kehoe; State Senator </li> <li>John Griesheimer; Former State Senator & Franklin County Commissioner</li> <li>Sue Allen; State Representative</li> <li>Cloria Brown; State Representative </li> <li>Mike Cierpiot; State Representative </li> <li>John Diehl; State Representative </li> <li>Tom Flanigan; State Representative</li> <li>Glen Klippenstein; State Representative</li> <li>Bill Lant; State Representative</li> <li>Noel Torpey; State Representative</li> <li>Chuck Pryor; Former State Representative</li> <li>Todd Smith; Former State Representative</li> <li>Dean Dankleson; Jasper County Prosecuting Attorney</li> <li>Eric Zahnd; Platte County Prosecutor </li> <li>Kathy Swan; Cape Girardeau City Council Member</li> <li>Jeremy Boucher; St. Clair County Republican Chairman </li> <li>Robert Hull; Worth County Republican Chairman</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
