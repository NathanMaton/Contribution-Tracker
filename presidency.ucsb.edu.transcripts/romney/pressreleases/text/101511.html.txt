What he really shouldn't have done is foist off Obamacare on the American people in the sleaziest process that I have ever seen in the United States Senate.&nbsp;You know the Cornhusker Kickback, the Louisiana Purchase.&nbsp;He said he wouldn't have any lobbyists in the White House? He didn't. He had them in the Blair House.&nbsp;It's the worst thing I've ever observed and the American people obviously deserved a lot better than what we got today."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
