Now He's Essentially Saying It's An Eight Year Proposition." </b>"It's a very different framing from the bit we played last night, where in February 2009, again just weeks after taking office, he said if I haven't turned this around in three years, it's a one-term proposition. Now he's essentially saying it's an eight year proposition."

Analysts, like Jonathan Alter on MSNBC, complained that it was too long at 54 minutes and missed the mark thematically."

The speech was long on Romney/Republican ruin and short on any credible Obama plan. Being for something is different than having a plan to achieve it. ... As I've written before, I don't think Obama has much to say about the economy. Today's speech reaffirmed that view, even though it took him more than 50 minutes to say it. The speech was lacking in many ways, but had plenty of gall. There is no chance the president helped himself today."
