No other candidate possesses his knowledge of the economy or how jobs are created and no other candidate will be able to take on President Obama. On Tuesday, I encourage my fellow Granite Staters to support Mitt Romney as our party's nominee so that we can turn around our country."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
