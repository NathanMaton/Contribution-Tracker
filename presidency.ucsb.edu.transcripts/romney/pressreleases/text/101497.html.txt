In his remarks on Friday, the President must address&mdash;directly and decisively&mdash;the massive, violent reduction in defense spending that is headed our way. Pink slips are looming, Virginia will be reeling come January, and our Commander in Chief is eerily silent on this issue.&nbsp;That, in my opinion, is a breach of his duty as head of our armed forces. &nbsp;<p>"The President should also address his full moratorium&mdash;an outright ban&mdash;on the development of Virginia's coastal energy. There is broad, bipartisan support for unleashing the job-creating potential off Virginia's shores &mdash; thousands of jobs! As he addresses future generations of Americans, the President must present them with the truth about the economy, along with the solutions that will provide a brighter future for them and their children and grandchildren, and the leadership to deliver on those promises."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
