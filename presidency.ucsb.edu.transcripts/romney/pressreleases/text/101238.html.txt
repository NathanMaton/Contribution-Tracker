But, nearly four years later, it's clear President Obama hasn't lived up to his promise. Millions of Hispanics remain unemployed and Hispanic-owned businesses are struggling under President Obama's job-destroying policies. From day one of his presidency, Mitt Romney will enact policies that get our economy moving again for Hispanics and all Americans." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Four Years Ago, Candidate Obama Promised Hispanics He Would Help "Tear Down The Barriers" To The American Dream And Create "Millions Of New Jobs":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In A 2008 Speech To NALEO: "We Can Tear Down The Barriers That Keep The American Dream Out Of Reach For So Many Americans. ... Create Millions Of New Jobs." </b>OBAMA: "And we can do something more. We can tear down the barriers that keep the American dream out of reach for so many Americans. We can end the housing crisis and create millions of new jobs. ... But I can't do this on my own. I need your help. This election could well come down to how many Latinos turn out to vote." (Sen. Barack Obama, <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=77557#axzz1wmiCabr7">Remarks</a>, Washington, DC, 6/28/08)<h4><b>But Instead Of Restoring The American Dream, President Obama Has Enacted Policies That Are Hostile To Hispanic-Owned Businesses:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Currently, The United States Has Millions Of Hispanic-Owned Businesses. </b>"Since its inception, the USHCC has worked towards bringing the issues and concerns of the nation's almost 3 million Hispanic-owned businesses to the forefront of the national economic agenda."

For example, a Hispanic small business owner who has been in business for over 20 years in Colorado and employs close to 200 employees stated that after becoming more aware of the new requirements imposed by ObamaCare, he believes his business cannot afford the new mandates. He further stated it would be cheaper to just pay the fines, thereby requiring his employees to use government-run health care." (Michael L.

It would thus favor big corporations at the expense of smaller businesses that file as individuals and would see their marginal rate rise to 41% or more under Mr. Obama's plan to raise individual tax rates."
