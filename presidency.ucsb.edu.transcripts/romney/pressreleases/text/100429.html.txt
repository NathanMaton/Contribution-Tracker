He would have 'flexibility' to pursue job-killing tax increases, for example, without having to face voters again. President Obama needs to level with the American public about what they will face in a second Obama term while they still have a chance to hold him accountable." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokeswoman<h4><b>Starting In 2013, Obamacare's $525 Billion In New Taxes Will Begin Hitting The Economy:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Obamacare Contained "The Largest Tax Increase Since 1993." </b>"Keep in mind that Mr. Obama has already signed the largest tax increase since 1993.

For first time, the bill also applies Medicare's 2.9% payroll tax rate to investment income, including dividends, interest income and capital gains. Added to the 0.9% payroll surcharge, that means a 3.8-percentage point tax hike on 'the rich.' Oh, and these new taxes aren't indexed for inflation, so many middle-class families will soon be considered rich and pay the surcharge as their incomes rise past $250,000 due to tax-bracket creep. Remember how the Alternative Minimum Tax was supposed to apply only to a handful of millionaires? Taxpayer cost over 10 years: $210 billion."
