Tonight, Mitt Romney clearly won the debate by remaining focused on his message of creating jobs and getting the economy back on track by reversing President Obama's failed economic policies. Mitt Romney's strong record of creating jobs in the private sector, and when he was Governor, makes him the best candidate to defeat President Obama and lead the country toward an economic recovery."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
