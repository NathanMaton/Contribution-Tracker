JOHN SUNUNU: </b>"Well, I think you're going to see the focus on jobs.&nbsp;Listen, the biggest problem in America today is twenty four and a half million people who are suffering because of the incompetence of a president who can't run a lemonade stand.&nbsp;This is a guy who doesn't understand his management responsibilities as President; doesn't understand policy responsibilities; keeps asking for the same thing.&nbsp;He has one formula: spend and tax, spend and tax.&nbsp;Einstein said that the sign of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. It's also the sign of incompetence.&nbsp;This guy keeps doing the same thing over and over again and expects different results.
