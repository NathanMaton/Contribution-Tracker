He will introduce tax reform that lowers rates and rewards job creators. And he will begin replacing Obamacare with commonsense health care reform. Compare that to what the first day of President Obama's second term would look like. On day one of the Romney presidency, we will begin restoring the greatness of America." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<p><b><i>Click Here To View "Day One": </i></b><b><a href="http://mi.tt/KjkEj6" target="_blank">http://mi.tt/KjkEj6</a> </b><p><b>COMPARE THE FIRST DAY AGENDAS OF MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA:</b><h4><b>Day One Of The Romney Presidency: Immediate Action To Strengthen America And Turn The Economy Around</b></h4><ul style="margin-left: 80px;"><li><b>Day One Under President Romney: Pursue Tax Reform That Will Spark Economic Growth, Expand Domestic Energy Exploration, And Address Runaway Spending. </b>"Romney spoke without a prepared text under a banner that read, 'Day One, Job One,' inside a sweltering North Las Vegas truck warehouse. He laid out 10 actions he said he would take on his first day in the Oval Office that would create more certainty for businesses. They include five measures that would: lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent; implement free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea; expand domestic energy exploration; consolidate worker retraining programs and turn them over to the states; and cut non-security discretionary spending by 5 percent."
