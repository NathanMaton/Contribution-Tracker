   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Four years ago today, President Obama promised voters he would implement an energy policy that reduces costs for middle-class families – but he's delivered exactly the opposite. Gas prices are surging and household energy costs will be driven even higher because of the President's war on coal. It's unacceptable and voters deserve better than President Obama's 'hodgepodge' policies. The Romney-Ryan plan will put the nation on a course for energy independence by 2020 and create millions of new jobs." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago Today, President Obama Promised To Implement An Energy Policy To Help Drive Down Costs For Families:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, Four Years Ago Today: "We Still Do Not Have An Energy Policy In This Country. ... Not Only Does That Mean That You Can't Fill Up The Gas Tank, It Means Everything's Gone Up." </b>OBAMA: "I don't have to tell you about gas prices. If you work here at this facility, you know what the rising cost of oil has done and the fact that we still do not have an energy policy in this country. And for the individual family, not only does that mean that you can't fill up the gas tank, it means everything's gone up. You go shop in the grocery store, eggs are up 20 percent, bread is up 30 percent." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks, Kansas City, MO, 8/26/08) <h4><b>But What Has President Obama Delivered?
