"Instead of enacting policies that create jobs, President Obama has grown government and added to our national debt which will have to be paid off by future generations. I am running to ensure that the future is as bright for our children and grandchildren as it was for my generation."<p>Kendel Ehrlich, Chair of Maryland Women for Mitt, said, "Women in Maryland and across the country back Mitt Romney because he is fighting for the issues that are important to us: bringing back steady jobs, making sure our country remains safe, and putting an end to the over-spending in Washington. He is a proven leader who will be able to bring change to the broken system in Washington and restore America's promise. We support Mitt because Maryland deserves a leader like him and we encourage Maryland voters to support him next week."<h4><b>Maryland Women for Mitt</b></h4><p>Kendel Ehrlich, Chair<br>Loretta Shields, Co-Chair<br>Audrey Scott, Co-Chair<br>Katja Bullock, Co-Chair<br>Amber Mulcare<br>Andi Morony<br>Addie Eckardt<br>Ann Miller<br>Annie Laurie Cechini<br>Barbara Coward<br>Barbara Yadvish<br>Beth Mulcahey<br>Betsy Merena<br>Bonnie N.
