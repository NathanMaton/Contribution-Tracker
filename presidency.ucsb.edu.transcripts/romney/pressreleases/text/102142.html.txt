   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"I actually think it will be interesting to listen to the President tonight. What I'd like him to do is report on his promises, but there are forgotten promises and forgotten people. Over the last four years, the President has said that he was going to create jobs for the American people and that hasn't happened. He said he would cut the deficit in half and that hasn't happened. He said that incomes would rise and instead incomes have gone down. And I think this is a time not for him not to start restating new promises, but to report on the promises he made. I think he wants a promises reset. We want a report on the promises he made." – Mitt Romney <h4><b>President Obama Intends To Outline "Specific Goals" In Tonight's Speech:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Obama Campaign Says The President Will Lay Out "Specific Goals" Relating To The Economy.</b> "With exactly two months to go until Election Day, President Barack Obama gets ready to give what will most likely be the most important speech of his bid for a second term in the White House. ...
