If you say, does his record deserve reelection and did he keep his promises, the answer is no. And so he's, I think, surmised that he can't win based on a positive telling of his record. You look at Obamacare, it's unpopular. You look at his calls for tax increases, that's unpopular."&nbsp; &mdash; Gov.

If you say, does his record deserve reelection and did he keep his promises, the answer is no. And so he's, I think, surmised that he can't win based on a positive telling of his record. You look at Obamacare, it's unpopular. You look at his calls for tax increases, that's unpopular. You look for his efforts to kill the Keystone Pipeline and choke off American energy development, that's unpopular. You look at his stimulus bill—that porky stimulus bill that he passed and said it was going to get the unemployment way down. It didn't work and that's unpopular. So with the exception of killing Osama bin Laden, he really doesn't have any accomplishments, or any popular accomplishments, and so he has only one main pathway to try to get reelected, which is to be negative and tear down Mitt Romney and I don't think the American people, particularly the independent voters are going to buy that."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
