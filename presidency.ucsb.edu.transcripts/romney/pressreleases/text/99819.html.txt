He also attacked his opponent for moving to the D.C. suburbs. But during his sixteen years on Capitol Hill, Rick Santorum became what he ran against.

Doug Walgren's (D-Pa) heart is in a Brabender Cox Direct TV spot. ... Santorum's spot is the essence of simplicity. Strange music plays while a picture of an attractive white house is shown. The announcer says, 'There's something strange about this house.' The reason is because Walgren lives in McLean, which is 'the wealthiest area of Virginia' rather than his suburban district. 'Maybe that's why he voted for a pay raise seven times,' the announcer argues."
