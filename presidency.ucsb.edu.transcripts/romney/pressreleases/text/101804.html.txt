"The Jewish community has made contributions to American society that stand in amazing disproportion to its numbers, and I am genuinely honored to have so many of its leading thinkers, diplomats, and political leaders support my campaign.&nbsp; Having just visited Israel at a critical juncture in the history of the Middle East, I am persuaded that now, more than ever, America needs to stand with Israel. I will extend the hand of friendship because our partnership is not merely a strategic alliance but a force for good in the world."<p>Majority Leader Eric Cantor said, "I urge all American Jews &mdash; Democrat, Republican, and independent alike &mdash; to give a serious look at Mitt Romney's candidacy. Throughout his life, Governor Romney has been an unwavering supporter of the state of Israel. As he stated during his most recent trip to Jerusalem, 'by history and by conviction, our two countries are bound together. No individual, no nation, no world organization, will pry us apart. And as long as we stay together and stand together, there is no threat we cannot overcome.' Governor Romney understands that peace in the Middle East will only be achieved when Israel is secure within its borders and not the target of violence fueled by senseless hatred. He will leave no stone unturned in the effort to keep Israel secure."<p>"Like every other group in America, American Jews want an economy that is growing and creating jobs for all who seek them. Given his background and experience, Governor Romney will succeed in turning around the U.S. economy where Barack Obama has failed," said Senator Norm Coleman. "Governor Romney understands the special concerns of the American Jewish community about the security of the state of Israel. Gov. Romney has just returned from visiting Israel; it was his fourth visit. He understands that Israel is targeted by the failed states of the Middle East as a convenient scapegoat. He understands that there is a worldwide campaign to demonize the Jewish state.&nbsp; It is for this very reason that he has pledged that his first foreign trip as president will be to Jerusalem. He intends to send a signal to the world -- and especially to Israel's adversaries -- that the United States is not a fair-weather friend of Israel, but a partner in an abiding relationship based upon a common commitment to our most fundamental values."<h4><b>Honorary Chairmen</b></h4><p>Congressman Eric Cantor (R-VA)<br />Former Governor Linda Lingle (R-HI)<br />Former Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN)<br />Former Senator Rudy Boschwitz (R-MN)<br />Adam Hasner, Florida<h4><b>National Advisory Board</b></h4><p>Evan Feigenbaum<br />Tevi Troy<br />Dan Senor<br />Dov Zakheim<br />Roger Zakheim<br />Eliot Cohen<br />Ambassador Eric Edelman<br />Ambassador Mitchell Reiss<br />Aaron Friedberg<br />Leon Aron<br />Phil Rosen<br />Sander Gerber<br />Lew Eisenberg<br />Eric Tanenblatt<br />Nick Muzin<br />Jeremy Katz<br />Barry Mannis<br />Ben Ginsberg<br />Victor Chaltiel<br />Fred Zeidman<br />Bruce Bialosky<br />Richard Heideman<br />Hon.
