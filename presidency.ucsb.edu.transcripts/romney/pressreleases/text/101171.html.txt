You don't, at a stage like that, you don't say, 'Well I'm going to go to bed and maybe someone else will take care of it.' You don't say, 'I'm going to go to bed because the wind might change.' You instead look for someone that says I'm going to take responsibility and fix this. Put it out. It's high time that we have a president who will stop this spending and borrowing inferno and I will. I'll get the job done. I love this country. I love this country as I know you do, but I'm concerned about this country. I'm concerned about the debt. I'm concerned about the spending. I find it incomprehensible that a president could come to office and call his predecessor's record irresponsible and unpatriotic, and then do almost nothing to fix it and instead every year to add more and more and more spending. And so if I'm president, I'm actually going to take responsibility and lead, and get us on track to have a balanced budget."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
