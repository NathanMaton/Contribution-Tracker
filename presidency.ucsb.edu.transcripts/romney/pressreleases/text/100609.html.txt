After Friday's disappointing jobs report, the White House is trying to spin the nearly 23 million Americans struggling to find work as a good thing. For the five million Americans who have been jobless for six months or more and the millions of Americans who have been pushed out of the labor force, the trajectory isn't good. That is President Obama's economic legacy, and that is why he will be a one-term president." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Despite Friday's Anemic Jobs Report, Senior White House Advisers Insist The "Trajectory" Of The Economy Is Good: </b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Senior Obama Adviser David Plouffe: "We Are Definitely On A Trajectory That Suggests The Economy Is Recovering."</b> "The president's advisers said it made little sense to get caught up in the vagaries of the job report, as long as the economy's overall trend was upward. ... ‘It's less important to focus on month-to-month than on the general trend,' said David Plouffe, a senior political adviser to the president. ‘We are definitely on a trajectory that suggests the economy is recovering.'"
