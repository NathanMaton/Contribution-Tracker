John McCain tore into Newt Gingrich Wednesday, accusing the former House Speaker of encouraging an explosion of earmarks that ultimately led to corruption in congress and for having a leadership style that would be problematic as president.<p>"I saw these earmarks explode. I saw the corruption that resulted from it," the former Republican presidential nominee said on a conference call with reporters organized by Mitt Romney's campaign. McCain endorsed Romney after the Iowa caucuses.<p>McCain said earmarks "dramatically expanded on Newt Gingrich's watch," and cited a memo he said Gingrich wrote in 1996 directing lawmakers in charge of spending decisions to "consider elections" when doling out earmarks.<br>...<p>McCain's criticism of Gingrich was hardly limited to spending. He said publicly what many of Gingrich's former colleagues have told CNN privately over the past week &mdash; that Gingrich's leadership troubles as speaker mean he would be a bad choice for GOP presidential nominee.<p>"The fact is he was a failed speaker and was not sent back. He could not have been re-elected as Speaker of the House and his leadership style was a major factor in giving him lack of support for re-election as speaker," said McCain.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
