We're okay, but the future of this economy worries us a lot," said Miami businesswoman Doris Del Toro, 52, a Cuban-American independent who voted for Obama four years ago and is undecided this year. "I'm just not happy with what Obama has done. He's moved way too far to the left. He spent too much time on health care when the economy should have been his priority." </i>(Adam C. Smith, <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/presidential-race-in-florida-is-a-coin-toss/1239479" target="_blank">"Presidential Race In Florida A Coin Toss</a>" Tampa Bay Times, 07/14/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Since June 1, President Obama or a major campaign surrogate (including the Vice President and First Lady) have held more than 20 events in Florida. They've taken airboat tours of the Everglades, attended ritzy fundraisers with pop music stars, held college campus campaign rallies and given commencement addresses.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Meanwhile, the Obama For America campaign has plunged more than $17 million into television ads in Florida, blanketing the airwaves with negative and misleading ads.

The figures were in keeping with national data that show that the slow decline in unemployment is due to "a smaller labor force and not to job growth."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Foreclosures</b> also continue to be a persistent problem in Florida. In April 2012, the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan areas had the second highest metropolitan foreclosure inventory in the nation, with 12.2 percent of all homes with a mortgage in some stage of foreclosure. (Press Release, "CoreLogic Reports 63,000 Completed Foreclosures In May," <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/about-us/researchtrends/asset_upload_file753_15532.pdf" target="_blank">CoreLogic</a>, 6/29/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rather than being focused on the economy, Floridians see President Obama as someone who "<i>spent too much time on health care when the economy should have been his priority." </i>In addition to skipping <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78637.html" target="_blank">Jobs Council meetings</a> to attend fundraisers with <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/26/2869338/president-obama-arrives-in-miami.html" target="_blank">Marc Anthony</a>, the few times President Obama has focused on the economy, his policies have been counter-productive.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Just last week, the President announced he would raise taxes on small business owners. The <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-17/news/os-tax-cut-winners-losers-20120717_1_tax-hike-tax-plan-taxes-rise" target="_blank"><i>Orlando Sentinel</i></a> looked into that position and found that "a quarter million Florida households would see their taxes rise" as a result of that tax. It's just the latest sign that the President doesn't know how to fix our economy.<h4><b>Obama's Policies Are Unpopular</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;">In addition to poor Obama Economy statistics above, the President's policies are proving to be deeply unpopular in Florida.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A 2010 <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_state_surveys/florida/27_in_florida_say_stimulus_plan_helped_the_economy_35_say_it_hurt" target="_blank">poll</a> found more voters think the President's $800 billion stimulus hurt the economy more than it helped.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a poll taken after the Supreme Court's decision to rule it constitutional, <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/12/2892871/poll-most-floridians-disapprove.html" target="_blank">more than half of Floridians said they opposed the President's signature legislation</a>, ObamaCare. More troublesome for the President, 55 percent of independents said they opposed ObamaCare.<h4><b>Floridians Are Rejecting President Obama's Dishonest Campaign Ads</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;">While numerous independent fact-checking organizations have looked into the Obama campaign's false and negative attacks, there's evidence that the President's ads are backfiring here in Florida, too.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Fort Myers NBC's Andy Pierrotti looked into the claims made against Gov. Romney about outsourcing and <a href="http://youtu.be/jEMG2nHshU8" target="_blank">found the Obama campaign's claims to be false</a>. The President's spokesman Stephanie Cutter even tried to plead her case on the station, but facts are stubborn things.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The past five presidential elections in Florida have been decided by an average of roughly 3 points. Despite the deep challenges facing President Obama in Florida, this will be a tightly contested race, and the Romney for President campaign will fight for votes in every corner of the state.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Still, after nearly four years of suffering the broken promises and failed policies of President Obama, Floridians are looking for real change.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Governor Romney's proven record and positive vision to grow our economy and create jobs for Floridians is more powerful than President Obama's negative and dishonest campaign, and the millions he is spending to run from his failed record. We believe more than anything else, that dynamic alone will prove decisive in Governor Romney's favor.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
