Paul Ryan. Knowing both men, I was not surprised. The fact that the governor chose someone who has a well-earned reputation for being principled, genial, articulate, intelligent and intent on restoring our country to fiscal health only confirms what I've known about Mitt Romney. <p>What also comes as no surprise are the attacks from the White House. <p>Consider the political scene as it must look through the Oval Office windows. Unemployment has been over 8 percent for every month of Barack Obama's presidency. Following four consecutive years of deficits in excess of $1 trillion, the national debt is up from an awful $10 trillion to a staggering $15 trillion. Economic growth has slowed to a crawl. <p>This record is not easy to run on, to say the least. Yet President Obama has a strategy for dealing with this political quandary. As he has said, "If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from." That is exactly what he is doing. <p>The president and his team are thus painting Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan as foes of Medicare, indifferent to the needs of America's senior citizens. But any fair appraisal of the facts will show that Obama is the one who has cut Medicare. He has cut it by $716 billion to fund Obamacare. Deputy Obama campaign manager Stephanie Cutter has even cited the Medicare cuts as an achievement. <p>But when it comes to Medicare, Paul Ryan has been one of the few voices in the Congress willing to put forward a substantive set of policies to address what non-partisan experts have long been warning about: namely, the impending shortfall in Medicare funds. The Romney-Ryan program will strengthen Medicare for future generations and ensure that everyone at or near retirement age retains existing benefits. <p>Obama, for his part, has not put forward a rescue program for Medicare. The contrast between the president and his challengers on this and other issues is stark. Romney and Ryan have put forward detailed proposals that will make our government simpler, smarter and smaller. At the same time, they understand what it takes to reignite our economy. <p>Romney knows what kinds of government regulations can get in the way of job creation. He and Ryan have a program to turn the economy around that is the most thoughtful and comprehensive I have seen in my lifetime, and I have seen a lot. <p>It is no surprise that the Democrats are spewing bitter attacks straight from the negative political playbook of attacking your opponents when your record is sparse. <p>When I ran for president, Jack Kemp was my running mate. Jack was a mentor to Paul Ryan. They come from the same stock of thoughtful and determined risk takers who never shrink from policy prescriptions that will better the country. <p>I am proud to know Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Given the problems confronting the nation, I consider this to be a dream ticket &mdash; for the Republican Party and the United States.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
