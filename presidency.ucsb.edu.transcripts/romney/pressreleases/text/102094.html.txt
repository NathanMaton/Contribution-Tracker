And what are the answers that I have and that Paul Ryan has for the issues that we face. And I believe that if people stand back and consider all that America has to deal with going forward, they'll recognize that we're the only team that has answers for these challenges. And they're big and bold answers. America needs that kind of help at a time when so many people are out of work or underemployed or having a hard time making ends meet." <p><b>WALLACE: </b>"If voters take away one thing from your big acceptance speech on Thursday night, what do you want that to be?" <p><b>ROMNEY: </b>"That I believe in America and in the American people.
