He clearly laid out the choice voters have in this election: do they want to vote for someone who is a creature of Washington or for someone who has been a strong leader outside Washington? Career Washington, D.C. politicians got us into this mess of high unemployment, runaway spending and reckless debt.&nbsp; We cannot rely on them to get us out of it.&nbsp; Mitt Romney spent his life working in the private sector.&nbsp; Mitt doesn't just have ideas about how jobs are created.&nbsp; He has real world experience creating them.&nbsp; Mitt is also a tested problem solver who has turned around big, troubled enterprises like the Olympics and Massachusetts. Iowans know our country is in trouble. As a proven leader, Mitt will not shrink from the challenges we face."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
