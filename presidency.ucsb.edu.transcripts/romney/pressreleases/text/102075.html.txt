He's committed to renovating America's education system, not merely reforming it.&nbsp;He knows that it needs more than a cosmetic do-over. It needs an overhaul that President Obama has been unwilling to deliver – one that puts students and parents ahead of administrators and unions. With Mitt Romney in the White House, real education reform will become a reality."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
