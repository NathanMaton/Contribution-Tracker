   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Today, Romney for President released a new web video titled "President Obama's Measure Of Progress." Four years ago at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, then-candidate Barack Obama said that Democrats measure progress by whether people can find a job and provide for themselves and their families. In September, President Obama and the Democrats will meet for the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina, a state that has lost nearly 50,000 jobs since President Obama took office and has an unemployment rate of nearly 10%.<p><i>To View "President Obama's Measure Of Progress," Please See</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/INWQbH" target="_blank">http://mi.tt/INWQbH</a><h4><b>AD FACTS: Script For "President Obama's Measure Of Progress" (Web Video)</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: </b>"August 28, 2008 Denver, Colorado"<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>SENATOR BARACK OBAMA: </b>"You see we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
