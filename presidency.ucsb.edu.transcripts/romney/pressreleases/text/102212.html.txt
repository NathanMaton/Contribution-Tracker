   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"It's been over a month since President Obama declared government – not hard-working Americans – was responsible for building our nation's small businesses. But it's not just the President's rhetoric – he's supported policies that are hostile to job creators, which will impede hiring, destroy jobs, and raise taxes on over 2 million business owners. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a bold plan that will get businesses hiring again, while creating 12 million new jobs and more take-home pay for middle-class families." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Last Month, President Obama Told Hard-Working Americans They "Didn't Build" Their Businesses:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama: "If You've Got A Business, You Didn't Build That.
