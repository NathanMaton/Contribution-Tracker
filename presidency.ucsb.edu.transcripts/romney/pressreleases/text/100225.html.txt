"Not only do they feed our country, they also are responsible for feeding billions of people across the world. They provide jobs for millions of Americans and are an integral part of our economy. Along with these leaders in agriculture, I will work to ensure that our food supply will remain steady, safe, and affordable for our citizens."<p>Announcing the formation of the Romney Agriculture Advisory Committee, Nebraska Senator Mike Johanns said, "As a former Secretary of Agriculture, I know the important role of our farmers and ranchers in maintaining both a healthy economy and an affordable food supply.
