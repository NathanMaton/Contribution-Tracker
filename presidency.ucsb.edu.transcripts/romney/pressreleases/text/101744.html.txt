Congressman Ryan is an unequivocal defender of American values, believes in America's exceptional role in the world, and understands that our influence internationally depends on our economic and fiscal strength at home. A more peaceful and prosperous world for America and her allies depends on American leadership.&nbsp; That leadership will be restored in a Romney-Ryan administration."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
