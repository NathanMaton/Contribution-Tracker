But after yet another disappointing jobs report and the 'worst economic recovery America has ever had,' it's clear the President should have spent more time focusing on creating jobs for the country, and less time trying to save his own job. On Day One, Mitt Romney will get to work to jumpstart our economy and put Americans back to work." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>For Nearly All Of This Year, President Obama Has Had "A Lot On His Plate" And Could Not Meet With His Jobs Council:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"President Obama Is At Odds" With His Jobs Council And Has Not Met With The Council In Six Months. </b>"President Barack Obama is at odds with some of his handpicked outside advisers on hot-button election topics such as regulations and corporate taxes.

Many members of the jobs council and three other of Mr. Obama's outside advisory groups, including his Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, have made the same recommendation. Mr. Romney has championed their view on the campaign trail, while Mr. Obama has been campaigning against it."
