The campaign also announced the support of five Illinois State Senators.<p>"My support is growing in Illinois because voters in the state want a change of direction in Washington and a proven leader as president," said Mitt Romney. "President Obama launched his campaign in Illinois, promising to change our country and change Washington. After three years, it is clear he has failed. With the hard work of these leaders, we can win next Tuesday and begin the process of turning around the country."<p>"Mitt Romney is the best candidate to unite our party, win in November, and lead our country's economic recovery," said Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno. "I am proud to support him and urge all Illinois voters who want a true leader in the White House to vote for him next Tuesday."<h4><b>Background On Leader Radogno:</b></h4><p>Senator Radogno serves Illinois' 41st Senate District.
