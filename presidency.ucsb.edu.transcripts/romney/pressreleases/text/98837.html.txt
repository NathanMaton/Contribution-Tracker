Conservatives need a candidate who not only shares our views, but is committed to putting them into action. Mitt Romney is the strong leader we need to reverse Obamacare, create jobs, and secure our borders. Americans cannot afford four more years of President Obama and his failed policies."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
