On Day One, I will begin turning this economy around with a plan for the middle class. And I don't just mean for those who are middle class now &mdash; I also mean for those who have waited so long for their chance to join the middle class." &mdash; Mitt Romney<p><b>Remarks</b><p><b>NAACP Convention</b><p><b>Houston, Texas</b><p><b>July 11, 2012</b><p><b><i>Click <u><a href="http://youtu.be/-mXwx2qkK3k" target="_blank">Here</a></u> To Watch Mitt Romney Discuss His Plan For The Middle Class</i></b><p><b>MITT ROMNEY:</b> "Now, as you may have heard from my opponent, I am also a believer in the free-enterprise system. I believe it can bring change where so many well-meaning government programs have failed. I've never heard anyone look around an impoverished neighborhood and say, 'You know, there's just too much free enterprise around here. Too many shops, too many jobs, too many people putting money in the bank.' What you hear, of course, is how do we bring in jobs? How do we make good, honest employers want to move in, stay in? And with the shape the economy is in today, we're asking that question more and more. Free enterprise is still the greatest force for upward mobility, economic security, and the expansion of the middle class. We have seen in recent years what it's like to have less free enterprise. As president, I will show the good things that can happen when we have more free enterprise &mdash; more business activity, more jobs, more opportunity, more paychecks, more savings accounts. On Day One, I will begin turning this economy around with a plan for the middle class. And I don't just mean for those who are middle class now &mdash; I also mean for those who have waited so long for their chance to join the middle class."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
