There isn't much good to say about a report that shows job creation well below what is needed even to meet new entrants to the labor market. <p>August job gains were disappointing for the fifth straight month, up only 96,000 overall and 103,000 for the private economy. That's a downshift from a still-mediocre 153,000 per month in 2011 and a 140,000 average earlier this year. To adapt a phrase oft-heard in Charlotte, that's going backward, not forward. <p>The unemployment rate dipped to 8.1% from 8.3%, but the rate fell only because 368,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force. That's 43 straight months with joblessness above 8%. The telltale labor force participation rate fell again to 63.5%, which is the lowest share of Americans over age 16 in the workforce since September 1981. That's going way backward. <p>... <p>Democrats also claimed in Charlotte that this was the best we could expect from any President given the hole he inherited that included 800,000 lost jobs a month. But this isn't what we were told in 2009. Mr. Obama promoted his $830 billion spending stimulus with the prediction that it would reduce the jobless rate to 5.6% with some five million more jobs than we have. <p>Judging by his convention speech, the President has nothing more in his policy arsenal beyond $100 billion more stimulus spending. The tax hike he wants to impose on businesses and investors planned for January is hardly inspiring employers to expand their operations and payrolls now. The Affordable Care Act is another dampener on hiring. <p>The single dominant theme in Charlotte this week was that President Obama and his party are the champions of the middle class. The August jobs numbers and the record of the last four years tell a different story. No Presidency has done worse by the middle class since Jimmy Carter's in the 1970s. <p align="center"><i>**In compliance with copyright laws, this version of the editorial is excerpted**</i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
