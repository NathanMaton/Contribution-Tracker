These ideas offered by Republican governors will help put America back to work and provide American economic and energy security." – Gov. Bob McDonnell and Gov. Matt Mead <p><b>An Energy Blueprint For America</b> <p>Politico <p>Gov. Bob McDonnell and Gov. Matt Mead <p>August 22, 2012 <p><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79952.html">http://www.politico.com</a> <p>During the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, the president experiments with mandatory health insurance penalties, a failed $831 billion stimulus and other issues. At the same time, he largely ignores a major policy area with tremendous, job-boosting potential - growth of the energy sector. <p>... <p>Unfortunately, after nearly four years in office, the president has failed to develop a sensible, comprehensive energy policy. <p>... <p>To fill the void in leadership from the president, Republican governors have developed "An Energy Blueprint for America" that gives a true assessment of the energy challenges and opportunities facing our nation and, more importantly, offers solutions for reaching our energy potential. The plan recognizes the need for a state-centric approach that utilizes every means of energy production. <p>Key provisions include: <h4><b>Regulatory Modernization</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· A cumulative cost-benefit analysis of the barrage of new regulations promulgated and enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency under this administration must be undertaken. <p>... <h4><b>Oil</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Approve the remaining portion of the Keystone XL Pipeline and ease regulatory burdens which prevent the construction and operation of adequate petroleum infrastructure. <p>... <h4><b>Natural Gas</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· End attempts by the federal government to restrict natural gas production and allow states to develop sound environmental regulation. <h4><b>Coal</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Reconsider federal environmental regulations proposed and promulgated under the current administration. <p>... <h4><b>Nuclear</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Support state leadership to provide safe and effective regulatory management of uranium development. <h4><b>Renewables</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Any renewable or clean energy standard for electricity production would be counter-productive and should be left to the states. <h4><b>Infrastructure</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Expedite permitting for transmission, pipeline and refinery infrastructure. Establish sensible regulatory policies for refiners and reconsider burdensome rules. <h4><b>Reseach and Development</b></h4> <p style="margin-left:.5in;">· The government plays an important role in research and development but long-term subsidies are counterproductive. The private sector must be profitable in order to develop new technologies. <p>Despite the impact of energy on every facet of the economy, America's energy future is not a focus of the current administration. These ideas offered by Republican governors will help put America back to work and provide American economic and energy security. <p align="center"><i>**In compliance with copyright laws, this version of the editorial is excerpted**</i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
