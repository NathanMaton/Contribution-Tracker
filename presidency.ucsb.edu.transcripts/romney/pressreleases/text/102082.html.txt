Terry Branstad: Obama Has Worn Out His Welcome</b><br />Des Moines Register<br />Terry Branstad<br />September 7, 2012<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20120908/OPINION01/309080025/Gov-Terry-Branstad-Obama-has-worn-out-his-welcome?Frontpage"><br />http://www.desmoinesregister.com</a> <p>Here in Iowa, we know Barack Obama very well. It was our caucuses that got his candidacy off the ground, and it was here that Barack Obama first unveiled his promise to the nation of hope and change. So four years later, it's no surprise that President Obama is visiting Iowa once again in an effort to recapture some of that old magic that has so far eluded him. <p>But after four years of his presidency, Obama may find that Iowans are not as welcoming of him and his campaign as we once were. <p>In Iowa, we know a thing or two about building success with our own two hands. Hard work is in our blood. It's our way of life. We don't look at our farms or our factories or our businesses and say, "Look what the government built." But government is at the center of President Obama's world view. He believes that the American economy should be directed, to some large degree, by Washington. "If you've got a business," he recently said, "you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." By "somebody else," he meant government. <p>Words have consequences. The president's world view goes a long way toward explaining his policies. Obamacare is $2 trillion federal takeover of the health care industry. Its regulations are paralyzing businesses across the country and already driving up the cost of health care. We can all agree that health care needs reform, but it is telling that the president exploited that need to expand the reach of the federal government in ways never before seen. <p>Obama also has a penchant for trying to pick winners and losers in the marketplace, though his investment strategy leaves something to be desired. Billions of taxpayer dollars were wasted on a bungled energy program, with the now bankrupt Solyndra serving as the most famous of the program's failures. But these losses pale in comparison to the wasted $1 trillion stimulus package that was supposed to get Americans back to work. Instead, its primary accomplishment was to thrust them ever deeper in to debt. <p>Now the president seeks reelection. His plan to address the ongoing economic malaise? A second stimulus and more government investments in private industry. More debt. More picking winners and losers. <p>That's not a plan. It's a plank from which to jump off a cliff. Fortunately, Mitt Romney offers a new direction and a new beginning. <p>Romney has spent most of his career in the private sector. He understands the economy and why jobs come and why they go. He wants to pare back those government regulations that crush innovation and discourage employment. He will eliminate Obamacare and restore decision-making about health care to consumers and the states. He is going to free our energy sector from the shackles that keep so much of our resources locked in the ground. <p>The sum total of the measures contained in his plan will have the effect of galvanizing the economy and restoring it to growth. <p>Iowa is important in the coming presidential election. We are considered to be a swing state. It is entirely conceivable that in a close election our six electoral votes may decide the outcome. That is why I am not resting until Mitt Romney gets the votes to send him to the White House. Iowa needs him. The country needs him.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
