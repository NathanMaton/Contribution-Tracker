He's never had a job in the free economy. Neither has Vice President Biden. They spent their lives as either community organizers or as members of the political class." –<a href="http://youtu.be/uAF4YWiKiSs">Mitt Romney</a>, "Fox & Friends," 5/24/12<p>In Des Moines, Iowa, tonight, Barack Obama continued his assaults on free enterprise despite the fact that 14 Democrats have repudiated his campaign strategy.

I believe business and labor have to work together. I think if you have a good business, you'll have good workers and if you have good workers then that's a good place to work,' he said.
