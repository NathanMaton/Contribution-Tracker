He will advance pro-growth policies that will yield millions of new jobs, higher take-home pay, and a better future for our economy." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman <h4><b>One Year Ago Today, Solyndra Filed For Bankruptcy Only Days After Suspending All Business Operations:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>On September 6, 2011, Solyndra Officially Filed For Bankruptcy After Closing Its Doors And Laying Off Its Employees Days Earlier. </b>"Solyndra scrambled to find a financial life preserver to salvage its fortunes just hours before it closed its doors last week, the solar energy company disclosed Tuesday in a bankruptcy filing. ...
