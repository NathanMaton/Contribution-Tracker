These supporters join a growing list that includes Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Jaime Herrera Beutler, Secretary of State Sam Reed, former Congressman George Nethercutt and former State Senator Dino Rossi.<p>"These leaders share my goals to get government out of the lives of Washingtonians," said Mitt Romney. "In order to lower spending, repeal Obamacare, and bring back jobs, we must first defeat President Obama. With the hard work of these leaders, we can bring conservative change to the White House."<p>"Mitt Romney has such strong support in Washington because he is the only candidate who can defeat President Obama and bring the principles we have been fighting for in Washington State to the White House," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "Our state and our country cannot afford four more years of failure from President Obama. He has failed to deliver on the promises he made four years ago and it is time that we have a leader in the White House who can fix our fiscal mess and save the economy."<p><b>Washington Elected Officials snd Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Member of Congress<p>Jaime Herrera Beutler, Member of Congress<p>Sam Reed, Washington Secretary of State <p>George Nethercutt, Former Member of Congress &amp; U.S. Senate Candidate <p>Dino Rossi, Former State Senator &amp; Gubernatorial &amp; U.S. Senate Candidate<p>Ralph Munro, former Washington Secretary of State Mike Hewitt, State Senate Republican Leader <p>Andy Hill, State Senator <p>Don Benton, State Senator <p>Joe Fain, State Senator <p>Steve Litzow, State Senator <p>Bob Morton, State Senator <p>Pam Roach, State Senator <p>Mark Schoesler, State Senator <p>Joe Zarelli, State Senator <p>Richard DeBolt, State Representative &amp; House Republican Leader <p>JT Wilcox, State Representative<p>John Ahern, State Representative<p>Susan Fagan, State Representative <p>Cathy Dahlquist, State Representative <p>Bruce Dammeier, State Representative <p>Paul Harris, State Representative <p>Larry Haler, State Representative <p>Bill Hinkle, State Representative<p>Mike Hope, State Representative<p>Kevin Parker, State Representative <p>Ann Rivers, State Representative <p>Jay Rodne, State Representative <p>Judy Warnick, State Representative <p>Dan McDonald, former State Senator and Majority Leader <p>Luke Esser, former Chair, Washington State Republican Party <p>Jack &amp; Sharon Silzel, Spokane <p>Pete Von Reichbauer, King County Councilmember<p>Kim Werdel, Executive Director, Jennifer Dunn Leadership Institute <p>Trina Wilbur, Party Activist<p>Carlos S.
