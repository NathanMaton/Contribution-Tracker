He just doesn't like the things that come from below the ground. That's the course he's on. The course I'll put us on is to take advantage of what comes from above the ground as well as what comes from below the ground so that America can finally become energy secure and independent of the oil cartel."- Mitt Romney<p><b>Remarks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>South Park Township, Pennsylvania<br>April 23, 2012</b><p><b><i>Click </i></b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgwdc6juBQQ" target="_blank"><b><i>Here</i></b></a><b><i> To Watch The Video</i></b><p><b>MITT ROMNEY: </b>"The road we're on, as Mr. Axelrod described it, the road we're on is one that says that energy's going to become more and more expensive. It's going to be harder and harder to get coal; harder and harder to use it here of course. It'll be sent to other nations around the world and used. But the cost here will go up. Harder to use natural gas. You saw the President kicked off the regulation, re-regulation of natural gas until after the election. Harder and harder to use oil.
