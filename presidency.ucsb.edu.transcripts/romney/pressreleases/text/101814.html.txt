I do. I'll put them in place and get America working again. You know this. These numbers are not just statistics. These are real people really suffering, having hard times. 23 million Americans out of work, or stopped looking for work, or way underemployed. 23 million. The official unemployment number: 8.3 percent. That's the longest period of time, 42 months, the longest period of time we have had unemployment above 8 percent in American history. Since this has been recorded. This is an extraordinary record of failure. The President's policies have not worked because he thinks government makes America work. He's wrong. It's people like John that make America work."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
