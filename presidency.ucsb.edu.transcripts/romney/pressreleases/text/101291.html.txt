It is clear that people aren't willing to buy into 'hope & change' again. Voters are making an investment because they believe that it will benefit the country."<p>"Our strong fundraising is a sign that Americans are tired of President Obama's broken promises and want a change of direction in the White House," said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. "We will continue the hard work of raising the resources to defeat President Obama so that we can elect Mitt Romney and Republicans up and down the ballot to get our country on the right track again."<h4><b>FAST FACTS About Romney For President, Romney Victory, and RNC Fundraising:</b></h4><ul style="margin-left: 80px;"><li><b>Over $76.8 Million Raised In May</b></li><li><b>93% Of All Donations Received In May Were $250 Or Less</b></li><li><b>$12 Million Raised By Donations Under $250 In May</b></li><li><b>297,442 Donations Received Under $250 In May</b></li><li><b>$107 Million Cash On Hand</b></li><li><b>Contributions Received From All 50 States And Washington, D.C.</b></li></ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
