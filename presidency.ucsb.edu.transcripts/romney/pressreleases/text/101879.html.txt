The campaign, RNC and state party participants have approximately $185.9 million cash on hand.<p>Announcing the numbers, Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said, "Once again we see that for many people, this is more than a campaign, it is a cause." Zwick went on to say, "We are honored to have the support of a broad spectrum of donors—Independents, Democrats and Republicans—whose support of Governor Romney shows that he has the needed plan to jumpstart our economy and get the country on the right track again.&nbsp; We are well on track to raise the money to be successful in November.&nbsp; If you haven't given, show your support by joining the group of donors who have shown their commitment to Governor Romney and the Romney Victory effort."<p>"Americans are clearly looking for a change in the White House," said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. "While President Obama claims that his economic plan 'worked,' the American people know that his policies haven't worked and he has failed to fix our economy.&nbsp; Mitt Romney has a plan that will create jobs, grow the economy, and build a stronger middle class &mdash; that is why he is seeing such strong support."<h4><b>FAST FACTS About Romney For President, Romney Victory, and RNC Fundraising:</b></h4><ul><li style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><b>Over $101.3 Million Raised In July</b></li><li style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><b>94.13% Of All Donations Received In July Were $250 Or Less</b></li><li style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><b>$25.7 Million Raised By Donations Under $250 In July</b></li><li style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><b>600,627 Donations Received Under $250 In July</b></li><li style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><b>Approximately $185.9 Million Cash On Hand</b></li><li style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><b>Contributions Received From All 50 States And Washington, D.C.</b></li></ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
