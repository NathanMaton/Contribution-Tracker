So here is the commitment that Mitt and I are making to you, our fellow citizens. We will not duck the tough issues. We will not kick the can down the road. We will lead. We will not blame others for four years; we will take responsibility and fix this country's problems. And we will not try to replace our country's founding principles. We will not try to transform America into something it was never intended to be. We will reapply our founding principles."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
