I'd tell people what it is right now. That's one of the reasons why I'm saying that all of the records that were part of the ethics investigation, all of the transcripts, all of the records have to be made public. Not just the final white-washed report, but the full record, the reason that 88% of the Republicans in the House voted to reprimand their own speaker, the first time in American history that's happened. We need to understand why that is and those records need to be released because you know that if Nancy Pelosi knows those things right now, she will hand them to Barack Obama's campaign if Speaker Gingrich were our nominee."
