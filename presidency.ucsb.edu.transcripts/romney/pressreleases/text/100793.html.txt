From green jobs that never materialized to an unemployment rate that has remained above 8% for thirty-nine straight months, President Obama's rhetoric simply doesn't match with his failed economic record." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Candidate Obama Promised To Create Millions Of New Green Jobs - But His Energy Loans Have Resulted In Bankruptcies And Layoffs:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, On Green Energy Investments: "An Investment That Will Lead To New Industries And Five Million New Jobs That Pay Well And Can't Ever Be Outsourced." </b>OBAMA: "And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced."

The bankruptcy also represents a high-profile failure for a federal stimulus program that gives loan guarantees to green-tech manufacturers. Solyndra was the first company to win one of the guarantees, receiving $535 million in 2009 to build its second factory in Fremont less than a mile from the company's original plant." (David R.
