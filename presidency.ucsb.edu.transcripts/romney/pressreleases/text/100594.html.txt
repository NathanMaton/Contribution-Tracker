But the President may want to check his math again, since his proposal has been panned by the media and economic experts. This latest tax hike scheme is just another example of a president willing to say and do anything to distract from his failed record of chronic unemployment and trillions of dollars in new debt and wasteful spending." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama Has Touted His Latest Political Stunt As A Matter Of Simple "Math":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama, On His Preference For The "Buffett Rule" Over Other Tax Plans: "That Is Not Class Warfare ... That Is Math." </b>"As both I and Warren Buffett have pointed out many times now, he's paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. That is not fair. It is not right. And the choice is really very simple. ... That is not class warfare, that is not class envy, that is math."

And that basic principle of fairness, if applied to our tax code, could raise enough money that not only do we pay for our jobs bill, but we also stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade. And as I said when I made the announcement, this is not politics; this is math."

That's less than one-tenth of one percent of the $1.2 trillion budget deficit Mr. Obama is scheduled to run this year.
