And their disaffection evidently helped persuade him to step down as speaker the next year and leave office."

As a well-known public figure, Gingrich would have to work to undo this last definition in particular." (David M.

"</b>Long before Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House, his closest Republican allies knew he was a managerial disaster, a mercurial force of nature who bubbled with ideas but lacked discipline. Their assessment explains why many Republicans who have dealt with Gingrich over the years exhibit almost feral anxiety about what a Gingrich general-election campaign--let alone, a presidency--would be like."
