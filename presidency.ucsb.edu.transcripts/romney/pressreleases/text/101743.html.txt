Ambassador John Bolton today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:<p>"Every American and every American ally abroad should be heartened by Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate.&nbsp; Congressman Ryan deeply understands that American leadership in foreign policy makes for a more peaceful world and a safer, more prosperous America. And he and Governor Romney will restore our economic strength at home that is the basis of our influence abroad.&nbsp; For nearly four years, we have seen the dangerous conditions that are created when a president refuses to lead. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will restore American leadership."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
