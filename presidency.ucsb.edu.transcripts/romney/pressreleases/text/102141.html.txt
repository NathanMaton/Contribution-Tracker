   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama's economic policies have left middle-class families struggling. But instead of offering families a hand up, the President is trying to give people a handout by gutting work requirements from welfare. President Obama is also hurting today's seniors by gutting $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. The Romney-Ryan Plan will restore work to welfare and strengthen Medicare for today's seniors and future retirees." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>President Obama "Gutted" President Clinton's Bipartisan Welfare Reforms By Allowing Waivers From Work Requirements:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Obama Administration's Welfare Changes "Quietly Opened The Door For States To Seek Major Changes" In Work Requirements. </b>"The Obama administration has quietly opened the door for states to seek major changes in how they meet federal welfare-to-work requirements for some of their poorest residents, and leading conservatives are crying foul."
