"This shows my message of a 'Simpler, Smarter, and Smaller' federal government is resonating with voters all across the country. I look forward to working with these leaders to defeat President Obama and turn our country around."<p>Announcing her support, Statewide Grassroots Director Laura Knaperek said, "I'm very proud to endorse a true conservative like Mitt Romney. The three years of President Obama has brought nothing but higher unemployment, out of control spending, and a border that is as insecure as it has ever been. As president, Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth policies, repeal Obamacare, and secure our borders. For conservatives, the choice could not be clearer: We need a change. We need Mitt Romney."<p><b>Arizona Grassroots Leaders Supporting Mitt Romney:&nbsp;</b><p>Laura Knaperek, Statewide Grassroots Director<p>Debbie Forrest, Co-Coalitions Director<p>Larry Perkins, Co-Coalitions Director<p>Angela Kebric, Young Republicans Director<p>Lauren Pemberton, Maricopa Director<p>Trevor Barrett, Gilbert Director&nbsp;<p>Justin Marino, Mesa Director<p>Brian Symes, Ahwatukee/Chandler Director<p>Gary Richardson, Tempe Co-Director<p>Ken Bonham, Tempe Co-Director &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Donna Reagan, Scottsdale Director<p>Ryan Williams, Central Phoenix Co-Director<p>Austin Wright, Central Phoenix Co-Director &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Peggy Neely, Phoenix N/E Director<p>Susan Davis, Phoenix/Arcadia Director<p>Chris Tolino, Phoenix- Ahwatukee Director<p>Debbie Belnap, Queen Creek Director<p>Colleen Lombard, Black Canyon Corridor Director<p>Josh Offenhartz, Regional County Coordinator<p>Myrna Udall, Apache County Co-Director<p>Laverl Ashcroft, Apache County Co-Director<p>Buster Johnson, Mohave County Supervisor & Mohave County Director<p>David Tenney, Navajo County Supervisor & Navajo County Director<p>Ed Parker, Co-Pima County Director<p>David Hoefferle, Co-Pima County Director<p>Mel Barrett, Yavapai County Director<p>Dr. Bob Cannell, Yuma/La Paz County Co-Director &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Donna Johnson, Yuma/La Paz County Co-Director &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Bill Konopnicki, Greenlee/Graham County Director<p>Joyce Carpenter, Coconino County Director</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
