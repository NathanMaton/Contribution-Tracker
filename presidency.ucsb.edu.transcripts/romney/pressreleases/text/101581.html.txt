   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Americans everywhere &mdash; including Senator Bob Casey, a prominent Obama supporter &mdash; all agree: government isn't responsible for building our nation's businesses. It's just the latest out-of-touch remark from a president who has consistently made life more difficult for job creators and middle-class workers. Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction by pursuing pro-growth policies that help entrepreneurs create new businesses and hire new workers." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Senator Bob Casey &mdash; An Early Obama Supporter &mdash; Has Distanced Himself From President Obama's Claim That Americans Didn't Build Their Own Businesses:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Senator Bob Casey: "Everyone Knows That When Someone Builds A Business And Is Successful, They're Successful For A Variety Of Reasons. One Of The Reasons They're Successful Is They Work Hard." </b>CASEY: "What I would say is&mdash;I'll just say it my own way. Everyone knows that when someone builds a business and is successful, they're successful for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons they're successful is they work hard. Usually, sometimes they just get lucky, but a lot of the times-- probably most of the time, at least in terms of people I've talked to over the years, it's hard work. They have to study hard in school, you've got to work hard to develop capital, to get access to capital. You've got to take risks that sometime put you in a jam for a while and you're fortunate enough to overcome that."
