Romney for President also submitted the signatures and paperwork required to appear on the Delaware Republican primary ballot. "I am happy to have the support of so many in Delaware," said Mitt Romney. "In order to win in November 2012, I will need their help as I spread my pro-growth message and reach out to voters in Delaware and across the country." Announcing his support, House Republican Leader Greg Lavelle said, "After three years of failed attempts to restart our economy, it is clear that the liberal policies of President Obama are not working. We need a president who has displayed conservative leadership and understands how our economy actually functions. Mitt Romney displayed this leadership as both a governor and successful businessman. With his economic know-how, we will be able to get our economy working again." "Mitt Romney has emerged as the only candidate with the experience and plan to take on President Obama," said RNC National Committeeman Laird Stabler. "He is a conservative businessman who was able to use those principles as governor to cut taxes and spending. I look forward to working with these other leaders from Delaware to help Mitt Romney defeat President Obama and reverse the economic stagnation of the last three years." <b>Delaware Elected Officials And Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b> <ul> <li>House Republican Leader Greg Lavelle </li> <li>State Senator Liane Sorenson </li> <li>Dale Wolf; Former Governor and Lieutenant Governor </li> <li>Janet Rzewnicki; Former State Treasurer</li> <li>Bob Weiner; New Castle County Councilman</li> <li>Laird Stabler; RNC National Committeeman</li> <li>Everett Moore; Former Delaware Republican Party Chairman</li> <li>Cathy Murray; Former Delaware Republican Party Vice Chairwoman</li> <li>Steve Engebretson; Newark Region Republican Chairman</li> <li>Hans Reigle; Kent County Republican Chairman </li> <li>John Rollins; New Castle County Republican Chairman</li> <li>Michael Fleming; Former New Castle County Republican Chairman</li> <li>Rick Carroll; Former Wilmington Region Republican Chairman</li> <li>Ted Cover; Wilmington Region Republican Vice Chairman</li> <li>Jerry Martin; Former Brandywine Region Republican Chairman</li> <li>Dave Burris; Former Sussex County Republican Chairman</li> <li>Dave Jones; Former Newark Region Republican Chairman</li> <li>Ron Sams; Former Sussex County Republican Chairman</li> <li>Jim Ursomarso; Former Candidate for Lieutenant Governor and Wilmington City Republican Chairman</li> <li>Michele Rollins; Former Congressional Candidate</li> <li>Judy Travis; Former Candidate for State Senate</li> <li>Louis Saindon; Former Candidate for State Representative</li> <li>Josh Hoveln; University of Delaware College Republican Vice Chairman</li> <li>Tom Schrandt </li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
