Bush From Defeat In 1988.</b> GINGRICH: "In 1980 I worked with the Reagan campaign. Ronald Reagan ended up beating Jimmy Carter by a bigger number of states than Franklin Roosevelt beat Herbert Hoover by. 1984, I worked with the Reagan campaign, he carried 49 states. In 1988, when Bush was down by 19 points, I got involved in defining Dukakis and that was in May and by November, Bush won by 6 which meant that one out of every four Americans switched between May and November."
