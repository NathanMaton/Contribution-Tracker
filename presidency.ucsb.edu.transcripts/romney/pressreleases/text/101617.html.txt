   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Days after a leading Democrat claimed the White House was involved in leaking sensitive security information, President Obama and his advisers still won't give the American people a straight answer on who's to blame. It's time for this White House to finally come clean and tell voters what they knew and when they knew it, so those responsible can be held to account for their contemptible conduct." &mdash; Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>President Obama And His Advisers Have Refused To Provide Straight Answers About The White House's Involvement In Leaking National Security Information:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>When Asked If He Could "Say Flatly That Nobody From The White House Was Involved In The National Security Leaks That Are Being Investigated," Spokesman Jay Carney Did Not Deny White House Involvement.</b> FOX NEWS' ED HENRY: "Can you say flatly that nobody from the White House was involved in the national security leaks that are being investigated?" CARNEY: "Well Ed as you know this is a matter being investigated by two experienced prosecutors. I can't specifically speak about it. I can point you to the statements of the President, the statements I've made in the past about this, about the seriousness with which he takes this issue..."

In June, David Axelrod flatly said on ABC that nobody in the White House was involved and David Axelrod was on MSNBC yesterday and said the President did not leak anything and then followed up by saying the President did not authorize any leaks. That's different. That leaves open the door that there were unauthorized leaks by White House people. So, have you moved the goal posts?" CARNEY: "No, Ed, I think you're conflating a lot of things. All of those statements are completely true. I stand by what I've said and Mr. Axelrod and the President has said..." HENRY: "He said no one from the White House was involved. Can you today say that nobody from the White House was involved?" CARNEY: "Involved in which particular case are you talking about? I can tell you that the President takes this very seriously."

AXELROD: "Well, Joe, I can tell you, that the President of the United States did not leak classified information, as Mitt Romney suggested yesterday, didn't authorize the leak of classified information, as Mitt Romney suggested yesterday, and I think it was largely a diversion because what's he going to talk about?"

Axelrod Again Didn't Deny White House Leaks, Saying "There Are Leaks Out Of Every Administration."</b> SCARBOROUGH: "Why is it leaking out of the White House? How do we stop it?" AXELROD: "Joe, there's an investigation going &mdash; well, you stop it by sending strong signals. Strong signals have been sent. There are leaks out of every administration."

Can you share a thought with us on how you feel about all this?" MCRAVEN: "Well we're never happy when leaks occur, obviously. We go to great lengths to protect our national security, very great lengths to protect our sources and methods. So all of that we guard very carefully. Unfortunately not everyone guards that very carefully. I think what you've seen is the Secretary and the President and Capitol Hill are taking these leaks very, very seriously, as they should. And we need to do the best we can to clamp down on it, because sooner or later it's going to cost people their lives, or it's going to cost us our national security. So it is important."

Any suggestion that the White House has leaked sensitive information for political purposes has no basis in fact and has been denied by the authors themselves, as one of the authors of The New York Times story on Obama's counterterrorism record said, 'The notion that the White House prompted the story or controlled our reporting and writing is absurd.'"
