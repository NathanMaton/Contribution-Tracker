   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced his national Hispanic Steering Committee.<p>"President Obama's policies have been especially devastating to Hispanic families. Over 2.5 million Hispanics are unemployed today, with the unemployment rate at 11% for Hispanics," said Mitt Romney. "President Obama does not understand that what makes our country great is our people, not the government. These leaders understand that for our economy to recover, we must free the entrepreneurial spirit that made this the greatest nation in the history of the Earth."<p>Announcing the Hispanic Steering Committee, former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez said, "Throughout his life, Mitt Romney has demonstrated the values that we are looking for in our next President. Whether as a business leader, head of the Olympics or governor, Mitt Romney has used conservative principles to turn around tough situations. We need a president who can do the same for our economy and country."&nbsp;<p>"The next election is the most important in decades," said former U.S. Senator Mel Martinez. "Whether we replace President Obama with a true conservative will have ramifications perhaps for generations. Mitt Romney's strategy for a 'Smaller, Simpler, Smarter' government will help get government out of the way of the private sector and allow for small businesses to do what they do best: create jobs."<h4><b>Members of Mitt Romney's National Hispanic Steering Committee:</b></h4><p><b>Sec.
