We cannot solve the problems in Washington with someone who helped cause them." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Senator Rick Spendtorum "Was A Great Pork Senator":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>"Santorum Spent His 12 Years In The Senate Working Hard To Bring Home The Federal Bacon To The State."</b> "Santorum spent his 12 years in the Senate working hard to bring home the federal bacon to the state; Toomey has always disdained that sort of pork barrel politics even when he was representing the Allentown area in the House from 1998 to 2004. When Toomey says, as he did today that Romney stands for 'the principles of limited government' that means something." (Jonathan S. Tobin, "Who's The Real Conservative?

'When I'm putting him first on earmarks, that shows that he's the guy who's got clout,' Specter said, adding that he helped Santorum secure a major job-training grant and that last year they jointly announced earmarks for defense companies in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley."

He was a great, I hate to say this, Rick, he was a great pork Senator. As governor, when I called Rick Santorum and I said 'we need this,' he got it. He was a great pork Senator. But above and beyond that, above and beyond that, people are amazed that he could be considered a serious presidential candidate." Q: "So you never got from him on the telephone when you'd call him about an appropriations project, you never got stuff about you've got to watch out for the deficit, we've got to spend less..." RENDELL: "No. And I pick my spots Mike, because, you know, I made sure the projects were good ones. But when they were good ones, Rick went to work and he got them done."
