   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Not Even Half." President Obama has given billions of taxpayer dollars to companies that later failed&mdash;including companies that were run by Democrat donors. This is just another example of President Obama's pattern of picking winners and losers and wasting taxpayer money.<p><i>To View "Not Even Half" Please See</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/Ko291P" target="_blank">http://mi.tt/Ko291P</a><p><h4><b>AD FACTS: Script For "Not Even Half" </b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VOICEOVER:</b> "President Obama is spending your tax dollars to create jobs."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "How's He Doing?"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VOICEOVER:</b> "How's he doing?"<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "Solyndra"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VOICEOVER:</b> You've heard of Solyndra."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "535 Million"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "Taxpayer Loan Guarantees (Your Money)"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "Bankrupt"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VOICEOVER:</b> "They took $535 million in taxpayer loan guarantees and went bankrupt.<ul style="margin-left: 80px;"><li><b>The Obama Administration Loaned Over Half A Billion Dollars To Solyndra – Which Later Went Bankrupt And Laid Off 1,100 Employees.</b> "In a blow to the Obama administration's efforts to create green jobs, solar-cell maker Solyndra announced Wednesday that it will close its remaining Fremont factory, layoff its 1,100 employees and file for bankruptcy. The news marked an abrupt end for a company once considered among the most innovative in a fast-changing industry. The bankruptcy also represents a high-profile failure for a federal stimulus program that gives loan guarantees to green-tech manufacturers. Solyndra was the first company to win one of the guarantees, receiving $535 million in 2009 to build its second factory in Fremont less than a mile from the company's original plant." (David R.
