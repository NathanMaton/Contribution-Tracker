After warnings about job losses and a hollowed-out military, President Obama is all too eager to pass the blame around for his own idea. As president, Mitt Romney won't play political games with our defense budget." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Today, The Obama White House Ducked Responsibility For Sequestration – And Even Tried To Blame Republicans:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, On Sequestration: "It Was Celebrated As A Victory By Republicans, Including Notable House Republicans At The Time." </b>REPORTER: "Mr. Woodward's book asserts the idea of sequestration came from the White House, can you confirm that?" ... CARNEY: "So let's not forget as if any of us could ever, the Budget Control Act not just passed in majorities in both parties in both houses. It was celebrated as a victory by Republicans, including notable House Republicans at the time. There seems a bit of revisionism in the way it's presented now as a political argument. It produced a bit of a conflict at the top at what is right and what is wrong when Republicans supported the act last summer." (Jay Carney, White House Press Briefing, 9/10/12) <h4><b>But President Obama's Top Deputies Were The Ones Who Came Up With The Idea Of Massive Defense Cuts:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama's Administration Was Behind The Idea Of "Massive Defense Cuts."</b> "The book 'The Price of Politics,' by Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward, makes it clear the idea for the draconian spending cuts originated in the White House – and not in Congress. According to the book, excerpts of which were obtained by POLITICO ahead of the Sept. 11 release, President Barack Obama's top deputies believed the prospect of massive defense cuts would compel Republicans to agree to a deficit-cutting grand bargain. Then-OMB Director Jack Lew, now the White House chief of staff, and White House Legislative Affairs Director Rob Nabors pitched the idea to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Woodward writes."

They were asking for an alternative state of cuts, or any kind of plan that would keep local employers – and, by implication, local contributors – happy."

Doing so would surrender his only leverage in forcing House Republicans to accept the expiration of tax cuts for the wealthy – the only weapon he had against their efforts 'to delegitimize me,' as he put it. Moreover, he bluntly called on Hill Democrats to reorient their priorities – from them to him. 'Look, guys,' he told Pelosi, Harry Reid, and several other congressional leaders, according to a person briefed in detail on the interaction. 'I plan on winning this race. If I don't win, then anything we say now doesn't matter. I plan on winning this race. So let's figure out how to win this race.'"

Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a spokeswoman of the Department of Defense." (Sean Gorman, "Rep.

Panetta, responding to a letter from Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham, said cuts of nearly $100 billion a year would leave the United States with its smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915 and the smallest air force in its history."
