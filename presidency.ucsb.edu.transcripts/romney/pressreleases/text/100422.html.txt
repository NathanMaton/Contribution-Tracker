Unfortunately, Senator Santorum has already admitted that he was one of those politicians himself. We need a candidate who can change Washington, not a politician who let Washington change him." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>This Weekend, Senator Santorum Derided "Politicians Going To Washington, D.C. And Not Standing Up For Their Principles":</b></h4><p><b>Santorum: People Are "Sick And Tired Of Politicians Going To Washington, D.C.

Sometimes You Take One For The Team." S</b>ANTORUM: "I supported No Child Left Behind. ... I have to admit, I voted for that. It was against the principles I believed in, but, you know, when you're part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake. You know, politics is a team sport, folks."

Bush's No Child Left Behind education law even though 'it was my against my principles.' For a presidential candidate, it was a curious &mdash; and unusual &mdash; acknowledgement of politics trumping values."
