O'Malley that Americans aren't better off today than they were four years ago is more proof that President Obama's policies aren't working. President Obama's&nbsp;failure of leadership&nbsp;has led to 42 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling for work, $5 trillion in new debt and a $716 billion cut in Medicare to fund Obamacare. <p>"While Team Obama continues their campaign of fear and division, we are talking about the big issues that Americans face. That's why we have a plan to strengthen the middle class and create 12 million jobs, protect Medicare, and cut the federal deficit so our economy can start growing again."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
