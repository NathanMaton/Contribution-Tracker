   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Romney for President today announced that former Jon Huntsman delegate Paul Collins and former Huntsman alternate delegate Brad Blais will support Mitt Romney.<p>"It is time for Republicans to unite behind the one candidate who can win in November," said Paul Collins. "Mitt Romney is the one candidate who can lead our party to victory in November and reverse President Obama's failed policies. He has the private sector executive experience that is needed to turn around our struggling economy. Our party can't afford to nominate a candidate with no job creation experience, and our country can't afford four more years of President Obama. That is why I support Mitt Romney and will work my hardest to help him become our nominee and make President Obama a one-term president."<h4><b>Former Huntsman Delegates Supporting Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p><b>Paul Collins &mdash; Huntsman Delegate</b><p>Paul Collins served as a senior strategist for New Hampshire to Governor Jon Huntsman's presidential campaign.
