And some social conservatives question his support of former Sen. Arlen Specter, who supported abortion rights." (Robert J.

'He went to an extra level of vindictiveness and nastiness against Pat Toomey,' said Shafik, the former Santorum aide, who worked on Toomey's failed 2004 campaign. 'He called up donors and said, 'Don't give to Pat.'' And he recorded a TV ad discounting criticisms of Specter as a liberal that finished with him saying, 'I'm proud to endorse Arlen Specter.' After the campaign, Santorum bragged that Toomey lost because of his endorsement, Shafik said." (Robert J.
