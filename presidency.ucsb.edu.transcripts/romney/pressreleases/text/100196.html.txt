If Governor Romney can do well here, he'll be much closer to his goal.&nbsp; Do Kansas a favor in voting for the best candidate on Saturday, March 10.&nbsp; Thank you and give Governor Romney your vote."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
