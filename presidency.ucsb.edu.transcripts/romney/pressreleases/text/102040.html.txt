Nearly 1 in 6 Americans are living in poverty, including a record number of women, and the middle class is struggling amid falling incomes, rising prices, and persistently high unemployment. While this may be the best President Obama can do, it's not the best America can do. Mitt Romney's pro-growth agenda will revive our economy, spur job creation, lift families out of poverty, and create a better future for our country." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Today, The Obama Administration Touted New Poverty Numbers As An Achievement:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Today, The Obama Administration Presented New Poverty Numbers As "An Achievement In Tough Economic Times." </b>"Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that the fact that the poverty rate stayed flat was an achievement in tough economic times. ...
