Today, it exceeds more than $15 trillion —the size of America's entire economy. The American people are all too well aware that this is money that they must eventually pay back.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; ">In January 2009, some 22 million Americans were unemployed, underemployed, or no longer looking for work. Today, that number has risen to nearly 24 million Americans. The average duration of unemployment has risen from 19.8 weeks to 40.8 weeks. In January 2009, 142.2 million people were employed. Today, that number has fallen to 140.8 million.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; ">In January 2009, the unemployment rate stood at 7.8%. &nbsp;It has been above 8% for every month since, despite the Obama administration's claim that their $787 billion stimulus bill would avoid such a high level of unemployment entirely. &nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; ">Meanwhile, the tepid "recovery" that the Obama campaign proudly touts as good enough for the American people is in fact no such thing. &nbsp;In October 2009 the unemployment rate peaked at 10.0%. &nbsp;Since that time, America's work-eligible population has grown by four million people, yet the labor force has not grown. &nbsp;Had the labor force continued to grow in line with the population, unemployment today would be... 10.0%. &nbsp;The entire decline in the unemployment rate is the result of people leaving the labor force or choosing not to enter in the first place. &nbsp;In short, the labor market has not improved; it has simply produced discouragement. &nbsp;Welcome to the Obama economy.</li></ul>&nbsp;<b>10 Ways Barack Obama is Destroying the Middle Class</b><p>&nbsp;The statistics paint a sobering picture for just what President Obama has achieved in his fight to "help the middle class reclaim a sense of economic security that will benefit the entire economy":&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Unemployment:</b> The number of people unemployed has grown by over one million. &nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Long-term Unemployment:</b> The average duration of unemployment has more than doubled, to an astonishing 40.8 weeks.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Jobs:</b> Nearly 1.7 million jobs have been lost.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Income:</b> Median household income has declined by nearly $1,000.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Poverty:</b> The number of people in poverty has grown by over six million.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Hunger:</b> Food stamp participation has increased by more than 14 million people, to a devastating 46.2 million.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Health Care:</b> Average family health insurance premiums have increased by more than $1,500.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Energy:</b> Gas prices have nearly doubled, to $3.38 per gallon.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Housing:</b> Foreclosures have spiked to a record one-million-plus annually.</li></ul><ul><li style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Debt:</b> Each family's share of the publicly-held national debt has skyrocketed by more than $35,000, to nearly $90,000.</li></ul>&nbsp;When Barack Obama ran for the presidency, he promised to "fundamentally transform the United States of America." &nbsp;Sadly, he is succeeding. &nbsp;He is pushing America toward a European-style entitlement society that would have been unrecognizable to our parents' generation - let alone the Founders' - with diminishing economic opportunity and ever-growing government programs and regulations. &nbsp;&nbsp;The election this November will be about whether the America want to continue in this direction, or reverse course and rebuild the Opportunity Society that has made her the greatest in the history of the world. &nbsp;Mitt Romney looks forward to offering voters that choice.&nbsp;</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
