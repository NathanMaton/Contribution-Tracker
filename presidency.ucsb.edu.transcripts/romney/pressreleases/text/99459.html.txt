   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Speaker Gingrich and Senator Santorum have over half a century's worth of time in Washington between them. They can't fix our country's spending problem because they helped create it. While Newt Gingrich may have opened the door to the abuse of earmark spending, Rick Santorum walked right through it. He renounced his belief that deficits are bad and voted to raise the debt ceiling by trillions &mdash; all while supporting billions in pork-barrel spending in Pennsylvania and across the country. That is not a record that fiscal conservatives will embrace once they know the facts." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Newt Gingrich Set In Motion The Largest Explosion Of Earmarks In History:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Earmarks Doubled While Gingrich Was Speaker &mdash; Setting The Tone For The Next Decade Of Spending Growth.</b> "Over the next four years, while Gingrich was speaker, the number of earmarks doubled to more than 6,000 projects, while total earmark spending increased by more than 30 percent, according to data from the Congressional Research Service."
