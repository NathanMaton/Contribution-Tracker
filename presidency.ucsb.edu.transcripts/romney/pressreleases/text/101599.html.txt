But his photo-ops are no substitute for a policy based upon shared values and shared interests &mdash; something we haven't seen from Barack Obama. Instead, we've seen his administration pressure Israel at a moment when Israel's security is under the greatest threat since the October War of 1973."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
