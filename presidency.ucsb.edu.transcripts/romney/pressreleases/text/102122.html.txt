The people coming together in America built the strongest economy in the history of the earth." –Mitt Romney <p><b>Remarks</b><br /><b>Jacksonville, FL</b><br /><b>September 1, 2012</b> <p style="margin-left:.5in;"><b><i>Click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2OqFiAs20&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Here</a> To Watch Mitt Romney</i></b> <p><b>MITT ROMNEY:</b> "We do those five things, we do those five things and you're going to see this economy come roaring back. We're going to create 12 million jobs over these next four years. You are going to see more jobs and more take-home pay, not just because you want it but because you deserve it. These have been tough years. It's been a hard time for American families, you know that, middle-income families, I saw a report just this morning, that, with middle-income families, that not only have jobs been lost, but it was middle-income jobs that were lost. And the jobs that are coming back are&mdash;the majority of them are low wage jobs. So even though we're getting a few jobs back, which is welcome and all jobs are welcome, the fact they are low wage jobs makes this even a tougher time for middle-income families. With a middle-income family income on average, or median income, down $4,000 a family. You think about that. At the same time health insurance premiums are up, and food prices are up, and gasoline prices are up and electric utility bills are up. These are tough times for American families. The President's answer to a time like this&mdash;he's saying 'play golf.' That's true. His political answer is to say, look let's divide America. Let's have Americans attack one another. Let's be divisive and dismissive and derisive. And that's not the right course. That's not who we are. The story of America has been a history of the many becoming one to accomplish extraordinary things. The people coming together in America built the strongest economy in the history of the earth."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
