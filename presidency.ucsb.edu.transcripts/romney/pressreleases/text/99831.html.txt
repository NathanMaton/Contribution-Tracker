   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Republican primary voters may be surprised to learn that Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have a lot in common. Among other similarities, they are both career politicians who were removed from office by those who knew them best and chose to stay in D.C. afterward. Mitt Romney offers something different. He is not a creature of Washington. He offers the kind of private sector and chief executive experience that career politicians can't match." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Speaker Gingrich And Congressman/Senator Santorum Are Career Politicians:</b></h4><p><b>Gingrich Embraces His "Long History As A Washington Insider."</b> "Gingrich, a former speaker of the House of Representatives, has a long history as a Washington insider.

He won re-election in 2000, but after a bitter and expensive campaign lost his bid for a third term in 2006 against his Democratic challenger, Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania state treasurer."
