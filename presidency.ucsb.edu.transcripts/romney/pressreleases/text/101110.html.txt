   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"This is another desperate attack from President Obama because he has no positive record to run on. Mitt Romney created more jobs in the state of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation. President Obama has failed to meet his own goal of 6% unemployment and has a net negative record on job creation. We're happy to compare the 4.7% unemployment rate Mitt Romney was able to accomplish. If President Obama had even half the job creation record of Mitt Romney, then he would be running on it." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<p align="center"><b>ROMNEY'S PRO-GROWTH POLICIES HELPED REPAIR MASSACHUSETTS' ECONOMY</b><h4><b>Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts' Unemployment Rate Fell To 4.7% And The Economy Added Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Governor Romney Inherited An Economy That Was Losing Jobs Each Month And Left Office With An Economy That Was Adding Jobs Each Month.</b> After taking office at a time when the state was losing thousands of jobs every month, Governor Romney's focus on fiscal responsibility helped create an environment where job growth returned to Massachusetts. Job growth increased throughout his term and the state added over 40,000 payroll jobs during his final year in office – the best year of job growth in Massachusetts over the past decade. Household employment grew by nearly 50,000 under Governor Romney and the unemployment rate declined to well under 5%.

In December 2006, his last full month in office, the unemployment rate was 4.7%.
