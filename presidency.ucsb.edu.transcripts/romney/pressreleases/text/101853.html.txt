But, instead of working to get them back on their feet, President Obama is unilaterally dismantling President Clinton's welfare reforms. Instead of tough work requirements, the President's policies could change welfare to work into old-fashioned welfare. As president, Mitt Romney will restore the bipartisan work requirement in welfare so that workers have the dignity of a job and not just a handout." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Last Month, The Obama Administration "Gutted" Clinton-Era Welfare Reforms By Authorizing "Waivers To States" From Work Requirements:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Obama Administration "Is Opening Up Waivers To States From The Work Requirements" That Are A Part Of President Clinton's Historic Welfare Reform Bill. </b>"After the Obama administration announced this week that it is opening up waivers to states from the work requirements contained in welfare reform, Republicans began to speak out against the move, complaining it completely undercuts the law."
