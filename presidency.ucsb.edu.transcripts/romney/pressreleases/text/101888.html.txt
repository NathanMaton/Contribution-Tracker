At this time of continued economic uncertainty, Mitt Romney has clearly signaled the focus of his administration will be getting federal government spending and debt under control and putting Americans back to work. The contrast with the current administration will be clear. The Romney-Ryan team will be ready to begin turning things around on day one."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
