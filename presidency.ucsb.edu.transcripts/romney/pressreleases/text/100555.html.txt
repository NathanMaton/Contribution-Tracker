President Obama missed several opportunities early in his administration to secure quick passage of trade agreements with Colombia and Panama which together will create thousands of jobs here in Florida.<p>"Instead, President Obama bowed to political pressure from powerful labor unions to stall these agreements. While President Obama played politics, Floridians suffered, and the U.S. lost $1 billion in agricultural exports to Colombia alone.<p>"Being President means making important choices each day that have real consequences for the American people. President Obama's trade inaction and political calculations are part of a broader pattern of economic failures for this president that have resulted in real pain for Floridians and Americans throughout this great country."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
