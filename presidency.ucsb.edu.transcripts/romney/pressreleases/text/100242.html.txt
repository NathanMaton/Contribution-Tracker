We must repeal this law immediately." &mdash; Mitt Romney<p>Today in Metairie, Louisiana, Mitt Romney leveled harsh criticism against President Obama's failed health care reform. "It was always a liberal pipedream that a 2,700 page, multi-trillion dollar federal takeover could actually address the very serious problems we face with health care," said Romney. "Sadly, the law itself is fast becoming the national nightmare that I and other critics have always predicted." Romney noted that, contrary to President Obama's claims in promoting the law, costs are already exceeding projections, insurance premiums are expected to rise dramatically, millions of Americans are facing the loss of their health plans, and Medicare beneficiaries are bracing for substantial cuts.<p>Romney repeated his commitment to repeal Obamacare, and outlined his vision for a health care system guided by state flexibility, market competition, and consumer choice that will provide higher quality care at a lower cost to all Americans. "Everyone can agree that health care is broken," said Romney. "So the last thing we should do is allow Obamacare to freeze the current system in place. Instead, we need to encourage innovation at every level. States should have the flexibility to pursue new policy approaches.&nbsp; Insurers and providers should have the opportunity to compete in a genuine market.&nbsp; Most importantly, patients should have the information and control they need to make choices about what they actually want."<p>Romney also announced members of his Health Care Policy Advisory Group: Scott Atlas, Tom Barker, Scott Gottlieb, Paul Howard, and Tevi Troy.&nbsp; This group will help Romney design policies that will strengthen the health care system nationally while giving states the power to innovate and individuals the power to control their own health care decisions.&nbsp; "I'm honored to have the support of this thoughtful and experienced group of advisors," said Romney.&nbsp; "I look forward to working with them to help deliver the health care system that the American people want."<p>"I think I speak for all members of the group in saying that we are thrilled to be supporting Governor Romney and working with him on this critical issue," said Troy.&nbsp; "He has been a strong, conservative leader on health care reform and I believe he is the one candidate who can reverse the damage done by President Obama and put this nation on a path to market-based health care reform."<h4><b>A Health Care System Guided By State Flexibility, Market Competition, And Consumer Choice</b></h4><p>As president, Mitt Romney will repeal Obamacare.&nbsp; This effort will begin on Day One, by issuing an Executive Order paving the way for Obamacare waivers to all fifty states.&nbsp; Then, he will pursue reforms at the national level that will create the conditions for a thriving, market-based health care system.
