With nearly twenty-three million Americans struggling for work and a labor participation rate that sits at a thirty-year low, America needs a president who isn't satisfied by yet another disappointing jobs report." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today, President Obama Hailed The Latest Unemployment Report As "Good News" For The Economy:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Called Today's Economic Report "Good News." </b>"Obama chose to focus on the fact that the rate of unemployment dropped from 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent, not the headline number showing the economy created only a net 115,000 jobs last month, below market expectations. ... 'That's the good news, but there are still a lot of folks out of work which means we have got to do more,' Obama said, as the unemployment data clouded the official launch of his reelection campaign on Saturday."

If you widen out the lens, we need 200,000 to 250,000 jobs to really make this, or to really illustrate that this is a healthy and strong recovery. We're nowhere near that. This number, in contrast, confirms the idea of a bit of a pause in the recovery. ... I think you have to look, again, more widely at the labor participation rate, and the unemployment to population ratio. Both of those have recovered far less—almost, very little actually—than the unemployment rate, so of course the unemployment rate is going to fall if the work force shrinks, but that's not a good measure of the health of labor markets, which remain profoundly weak."
