Last night, the people of Illinois told him that it is." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>The People Of Illinois Overwhelmingly Disagreed With Senator Santorum's Assessment That The Economy Isn't The "Real Issue In This Election":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Santorum's Recent Comments Downplaying The Importance Of The Economy Were Not Well Received In Illinois, Where Most Primary Voters Said The Economy Was Their Top Concern.</b> "Santorum handed Romney easy-to-load ammunition when he tried to add lift to his campaign beyond kitchen-table economics. 'We need a candidate who's going to be a fighter for freedom. Who's going to get up and make that the central theme in this race because it is the central theme in this race,' Santorum said in Illinois. 'I don't care what the unemployment rate's going to be.' ... A majority of Illinois voters on Tuesday named the economy as their top concern, according to exit polls."

And exit polls strongly suggest that Illinois voters do care about unemployment. Nearly 60 percent of Illinois residents casting ballots said the economy is the most important issue facing the country. Among those voters, Romney demolished Santorum, 49 percent to 32 percent."

Of that group, Romney won 62 percent of the vote as compared to 19 percent for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and just 8 percent for Santorum. Those results continue a pattern we've seen throughout the presidential primary process."

Most recently, he backpedaled after saying on Monday that the economy wasn't the main issue of the campaign. 'Occasionally you say some things where you wish you had a do-over,' he said later."
