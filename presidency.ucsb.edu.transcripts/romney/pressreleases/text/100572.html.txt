"This continued wave of support shows that Pennsylvania voters are looking for leaders like Jane and myself that want to implement pro-growth policies like cutting spending and reforming entitlements. I look forward to working with her throughout the next few months as we seek to reverse the failed policies of President Obama."<p>"I'm very proud to stand with Mitt Romney," said State Senator Jane Earll. "When I think of the challenges both Pennsylvania and our country face in the years ahead, there is no other candidate I trust more than him. He has laid out an economic plan that will encourage entrepreneurs and create jobs for middle class families. That's the type of leadership we need in a president. We are kidding ourselves if we expect creatures of Washington to be the ones that turn it around. Mitt Romney spent his life in the real economy, balancing budgets and building businesses and knows how to do the same for our country."<p><b>Background on Jane Earll:</b><p>Jane Earll was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1996. Before being elected to the State Senate, Earll practiced law for over twelve years.
