   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Speaker Gingrich just doesn't seem to get it. Our staggering national debt and recurring deficits are jeopardizing America's fiscal future &mdash; yet he attacks critics of his moon base proposal for being 'cheap' and 'stingy.' Combined with his record as the 'granddaddy of earmarks' and his past criticism of fiscal conservatives, it's not surprising that his campaign hasn't left the launch pad." &mdash;Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Yesterday, Gingrich Argued That Anyone Opposing His Moon Colony Proposal Is "Cheap":</b></h4><p><b>Gingrich, On Those Critical Of His Moon Colonization Plan: "They're Cheap."</b> GINGRICH: "This is the difference between the Republican establishment, which is the cheap version of the Democratic establishment. I mean, why did my two Republican competitors instinctively decide we couldn't go into space? Because they're cheap." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks in Dayton, OH, 2/7/12)<h4><b>Newt Went On To Rail Against The Very Idea Of Cutting Government Spending:</b></h4><p><b>Gingrich: "I Am Not Into Some Idea That Says, Oh Gosh, We're Going To Have To Cut This And Cut That ... And We're Going To Somehow Cut Our Way Into A Better Future."</b> GINGRICH: "This campaign &mdash; in the Republican Party &mdash; is about two very different philosophies. I am not into austerity and pain. I am not into some idea that says, oh gosh, we're going to have to cut this and cut that and cut the next thing. And you're going to have to take a cut in Social Security, and you're going to take a cut in Medicare, and you're going take a cut in something else and we're going to somehow cut our way into a better future." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks in Columbus, OH, 2/7/12)<p><b>Gingrich: "This Is Not A Country Which Is Stingy."</b> GINGRICH: "This is a race where there's a big difference between Newt Gingrich and Romney and Santorum. Both of them said, 'Oh no, this &mdash; we can't go do this.' Well, let me tell you, this is not a country which is stingy." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks in Columbus, OH, 2/7/12)<h4><b>A Reminder &mdash; The Gingrich Lunar Colony Could Cost Up To Half A Trillion Dollars:</b></h4><p><b>Gingrich's Plan Could Ultimately Cost Half A Trillion Dollars.</b> "In 2004, when President George W. Bush introduced a space exploration initiative that aimed to establish a base on the moon costs were projected to be about $100 billion through 2020. President Obama, however, canceled the mission in 2010, because it was running behind schedule and was costing too much money. ... John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University and founder of the school's Space Policy Institute ... says a similar mission today could cost somewhere between $250 billion to $500 billion."

Indeed the $1.079 trillion deficit now projected for the 2012 fiscal year ending Sept. 30 is wider than what the added CBO had predicted in August..."

Passive, Lean, Inactive Government."</b> QUESTION: "Several years ago you described yourself as a 'Jeffersonian populist.' Could you please explain that?" GINGRICH: "It's one of the points I make to conservatives who often describe themselves as 'Jeffersonian conservatives.' It usually means they want passive, lean, inactive government. That I would never favor, nor did Jefferson."
