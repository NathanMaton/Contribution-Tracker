   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:<p>"Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama's disastrous healthcare law means a future of higher costs, fewer choices, and less control over our healthcare decisions for citizens of Wisconsin. It means a future where Americans pay more for a lesser quality of healthcare. And it means a future of greater debt for the children of Wisconsin. As Governor Romney has said many times, no matter what happens in Court, we must dedicate ourselves to repealing this law, and he has promised to do just that, starting on day one of his administration. With Governor Romney's leadership, we can replace Obamacare with healthcare solutions that provide exceptional medical care without bankrupting future generations."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
