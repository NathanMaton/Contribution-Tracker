And perhaps the biggest failure is as it relates to the greatest threat that America faces and the world faces, which is a nuclear Iran. The President has not drawn us further away from a nuclear Iran. In fact, Iran is closer to having a weapon, closer to having nuclear capability than when he took office. This is the greatest failure, in my opinion, of his foreign policy. He ran for office saying he was going to meet with Ahmadinejad. He was going to meet with Castro, Kim Jong-il. All the world's worst actors, without precondition, he'd meet with them in his first year."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
