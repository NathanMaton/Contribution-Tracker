This coalition will lead an effort to increase support among the public safety community for Mitt Romney and ensure that our country is a safe and healthy place to live. <p>"I want to thank each and every one of the dedicated public safety officials that have agreed to join my team as members of Public Safety Professionals for Romney," said Mitt Romney. "Every day, peace officers from around this country put their life on the line to ensure that our citizens can live in safety. The men and women who have pledged to support me today represent the best and the bravest, and they personify the courage and fortitude of our nation's sheriffs and public safety officials. I am especially honored that Mayor Giuliani, Congressman Reichert, and Sherriff Bouchard have agreed to chair Public Safety Professionals for Romney. Their example and selfless commitment to public safety has set the standard that I will look to in this campaign and especially if I am fortunate enough to become the next President of the United States." <p>"I am honored to serve alongside Congressman David Reichert and Sheriff Michael Bouchard as Chairman of Governor Romney's Public Safety Coalition," said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. "The first obligation of government is to protect our citizens, and those peace officers who dedicate their lives to that honorable cause are among our most cherished heroes. The men and women who have joined Public Safety Professionals for Romney are some of the most accomplished and respected members of their profession. Together, we will help Governor Romney to not only win this year's election, but also to ensure that every city in America is a safe and healthy place to live and raise a family." <p>"Having served as a county sheriff, I know that these brave men and women put their lives on the line every day to protect our families," said Congressman Dave Reichert. "They deserve a president who appreciates their sacrifices and understands what it takes to keep Americans safe. Mitt Romney will be that president, and together with Paul Ryan, they will usher in a new era of leadership in Washington that creates good jobs, brings down the poverty rate, and helps provide a future other than crime for our at-risk youth. I am proud to support them." <p>"As the sheriff of Oakland County, I know something about leadership," said Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard. "That's why I am so pleased to be a part of Public Safety Professionals for Romney. Mitt Romney has governed a state, and he knows first-hand the support that we in the law enforcement community need to keep our communities safe. His record is impeccable, and I look forward to having such a great friend and ally to police officers and sheriffs in the White House." <h4><b><u>Chairmen</u></b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Mayor Rudy Giuliani <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Congressman David Reichert (R-WA) <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Michael Bouchard; Oakland County, Michigan <h4><b><u>Honorary Co-Chairs</u></b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Congressman Rich Nugent (R-FL) <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Congresswoman Sandy Adams (R-FL) <h4><b><u>National Advisory Board</u></b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff John Rutherford; Jacksonville, Florida <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff David Gee; Hillsborough County, Florida <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Graham Fountain, Director of Law Enforcement Operations; Walton County, Florida <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Carolyn "Bunny" Welsh; Chester County, Pennsylvania <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Joseph McGinn; Delaware County, Pennsylvania <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Christopher Hailey; Mecklenburg County, North Carolina <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff BJ Barnes; Guilford County, North Carolina <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Honorable Marla Graff Decker, Secretary of Public Safety, Virginia <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Ken Stolle; Virginia Beach, Virginia <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Jeff Grey; Mercer County, Ohio <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Dennis Conard; Scott County, Iowa <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff John LeClere; Delaware County, Iowa <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Ted Kamatchus, Marshall County, Iowa <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Scott Hilliard; Merrimack County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Craig Wiggin; Belknap County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Christopher Conley; Carroll County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Wayne Estes; Strafford County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Michael Downing; Rockingham County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Douglas Dutile; Grafton County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Richard Foote; Cheshire County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff James Hardy; Hillsborough County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dennis Hogan, Hillsborough County Attorney; New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Gerald Marcou; Coos County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Michael Prozzo; Sullivan County, New Hampshire <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dan May, District Attorney; El Paso County, Colorado <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff David Weaver; Douglas County, Colorado <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Rick Whitney; Allegany County, New York <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Adrian Anderson; Dutchess County, New York <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Tim Howard; Erie County, New York <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Don Smith; Putnam County, New York <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ed Mullins; President, New York City Sergeants Benevolent Association <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff Jeff Long; Williamson County, Tennessee <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sheriff J.J.
