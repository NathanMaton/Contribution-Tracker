"Across the country, people are struggling as a result of President Obama's poor stewardship over our economy. I'm grateful to these women for joining me in my campaign to replace this administration's failed policies with a pro-growth vision for our extraordinary nation."<p>"I'm proud to be heading up this effort to reach out to women voters," said Women for Mitt National Chairwoman Ann Romney. "There is no doubt that women will play a critical role in determining the outcome of this election, and that's something Mitt understands well. He also knows how to turn around this economy so that it will better serve the interests of women and families across America."<p>"All across America, women are tired of the President's failed policies," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "Since President Obama can't run on his record, he's resorted to scare tactics to distract and divide women &mdash; namely, the so-called 'War on Women,' which is a total myth. The women of America aren't falling for it. They want real solutions and real leadership. Mitt Romney will provide that leadership."&nbsp;<p>Former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey said, "Having served with Gov. Romney for four years in Massachusetts, I'm honored to spread his positive vision for America to women throughout the country. During the time he was Governor, women composed half of Gov. Romney's cabinet and many more served as highly-respected, top-level advisers. Looking at Mitt's extraordinary track record supporting women in the workforce, it's clear that whether women choose to work at home, in government or the private sector, Mitt understands and respects the value of each woman's contribution to American prosperity. I'm confident that a Romney presidency would continue to show that same kind of appreciation for the value of women's voices and women's skills to the project of renewing our country."<p>"As a mother of six, I'm proud to stand with Mitt in his efforts to restore common sense and fiscal responsibility in Washington," said author and television host Rachel Campos Duffy. "Under President Obama's Administration, the national debt has ballooned to almost $16 trillion. That's a profoundly immoral legacy to leave our children, and it's why I'm committed to helping Mitt's campaign defeat President Obama this fall."<h4><b>Women for Mitt National Chairwoman</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ann Romney<h4><b>Women for Mitt National Advisory Board</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Condoleezza Rice, Former Secretary of State<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Kerry Healey, former Lt.
