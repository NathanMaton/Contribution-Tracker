Paul Ryan that would restructure Medicare if it reached his desk as President, but quickly added that he would be offering his own plan." (Emily Friedman, "Romney Talks To ABC News About Health Care, Jobs, Ties And Red Sox," <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/06/romney-talks-to-abc-news-about-health-care-jobs-ties-and-red-sox/">ABC News</a>, 6/2/11)<h4><b>Romney Has Repeatedly Praised The Ryan Plan &mdash; Saying It Sets "The Right Tone" &mdash; And Notes Similarities With His Own Plan:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Romney, In April:</b> <b>"[Ryan] Is Setting The Right Tone For Finally Getting Spending And Entitlements Under Control.

I Appreciate What Paul Ryan Has Done."</b> ROMNEY: "I applaud Representative Ryan for putting a plan on the table that acknowledges that Medicare can't go on like it is without ultimately hitting a wall. I want Medicare to survive not just for those that are current retirees or near retirees &mdash; and of course the Ryan plan doesn't change Medicare for any retiree or near retiree &mdash; but I want Medicare to survive for younger people, in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and early 50s, and Paul Ryan lays out a plan to do just that. I'm waiting to see what Democrats have. I know at this stage all they have is criticism. But if we don't make any changes, then Medicare won't be there for the next generation and that's unacceptable to me. So I appreciate what Paul Ryan has done." (Mitt Romney, Remarks in Ankeny, IA, 5/27/11)<h4><b>Congressman Ryan Praised Romney's Fiscal Plan As "A Great Development":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Ryan Said Romney's Fiscal Policy Is "Perfectly In Keeping With Serious Reform." </b>"I asked [Ryan] about Romney's decision to offer traditional Medicare as one option in the premium support plan. He said that he and former Fed vice chairwoman Alice Rivlin had discussed that idea, and so long as the government, as Romney detailed, would provide a capped amount to be used either for traditional Medicare or for private plans, the same cost savings could be obtained under Romney's plan as under the plan Ryan proposed as part of the 2012 budget. Ryan deemed this approach as ‘perfectly in keeping with serious reform.'"
