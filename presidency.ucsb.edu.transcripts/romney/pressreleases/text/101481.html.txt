In contrast, President Obama will end Medicare as we know it &mdash; he takes hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to spend on Obamacare and will leave seniors with fewer choices. He has offered no serious plan of his own to save Medicare and is content to use it as nothing more than a political issue." &mdash;Lanhee Chen, Romney Campaign Policy Director<h4><b>President Obama Has Raided Seniors' Medicare by $500 Billion To Pay For Obamacare:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama "Will Reduce Medicare Outlays By $507 Billion."&nbsp;</b>"In February 2011, CBO estimated that the permanent reductions in the annual&nbsp;updates to Medicare's payment rates for most services in the fee-for-service sector&nbsp;(other than physicians' services) and the new mechanism for setting payment rates in&nbsp;the Medicare Advantage program will reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion during&nbsp;the 2012&mdash;2021 period."

Medicare, which is expected to provide health insurance to more than 50 million elderly and disabled Americans this year, is expected to start operating in the red in its largest fund in 2024, according to the annual assessment by the trustees charged with overseeing the programs."
