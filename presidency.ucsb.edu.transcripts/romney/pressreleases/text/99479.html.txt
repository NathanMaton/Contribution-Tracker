   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced additional Colorado current and former elected leaders supporting his campaign.<p>"The endorsements by these leaders from all across Colorado are a sign that my message of smaller government is resonating with Coloradans," said Mitt Romney. "Colorado will be an important state in our efforts to bring conservative change to Washington. I look forward to working with these leaders in that effort."<p>Announcing his support, State Representative Kevin Priola said, "So many leaders in Colorado support Mitt Romney because he is the only candidate who will be able to fix the mess in Washington. President Obama came to Colorado four years ago and made promises to Coloradans that he has not kept. Instead of fixing our economy, President Obama has only grown government and made job creation more difficult. Mitt Romney spent most of his life in the private sector and knows how jobs are created because he has had one. He will use the lessons he learned in the private sector to grow our economy and bring jobs to Colorado. That is why I support Mitt Romney and urge Coloradans to support him Tuesday &mdash; our country deserves a leader like him."<p><b>Colorado Elected Officials And Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Erik Hansen, Adams County Commissioner<br>Matt Heimerich, former Crowley County Commissioner<br>John Odom, Jefferson County Commissioner<br>Wayne Williams, El Paso County Clerk<br>Jean White, State Senator<br>Tom Massey, State Representative<br>Spencer Swalm, State Representative<br>Mark Waller, State Representative<br>Cheri Gerou, State Representative<br>Larry Liston, State Representative<br>Kevin Priola, State Representative<br>Jim Kerr, State Representative<br>Carole Murray, State Representative<br>Rob Witwer, former State Representative<br>Dan May, 4th Judicial District Attorney<br>Ben Nighthorse Campbell, former US Senator<br>Frances Owens, former First Lady of Colorado<br>Marti Allbright Whitmore, former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Colorado<p><b>Colorado Elected Officials and Leaders Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Senator Hank Brown<br>Governor Bill Owens<br>Senator Wayne Allard<br>Attorney General John Suthers<br>Congressman Bob Beauprez<br>Claudia Beauprez<br>Colorado Treasurer Walker Stapleton<br>University Of Colorado Regent-At-Large Steve Bosley<br>Colorado Speaker of the House Frank McNulty<br>Scott Gessler, Colorado Secretary of State<br>Kyle Hybl, CU Regent, 5th Congressional District<br>Nancy Spence, State Senator<br>B.J.
