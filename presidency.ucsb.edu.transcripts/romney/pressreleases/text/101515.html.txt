   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Coming off the worst quarter of job creation in two years, and with the worst jobs record of any president in modern history, it's clear President Obama has failed to live up to his promises. Yet President Obama is listening more to his campaign donors and special interest groups than to his own jobs council. That makes perfect sense for a president more concerned with re-election than getting the economy back on track." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Today It Was Reported That President Obama's "Jobs Council" Hasn't Met For Six Months:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama's Jobs Council Hasn't Held A Meeting In The Last Six Months.</b> "President Barack Obama's Jobs Council hasn't met publicly for six months, even as the issue of job creation dominates the 2012 election. At this point, the hiatus &mdash; which reached the half-year mark Tuesday &mdash; might be less awkward than an official meeting, given the hornet's nest of issues that could sting Obama and the council members if the private-sector panel gets together."

That proposal, to limit U.S. taxes on American multinational companies to their profits inside the U.S., was also endorsed by Obama's Jobs Council &mdash; but rejected by the president."
