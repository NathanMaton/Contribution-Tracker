I'd look at the facts that we've had unemployment above 8 percent for 42 months, despite the President's claims that the stimulus would provide the contrary. We're not better off than we were four years ago. Look at all the statistics. And I think that's why we're going to be offering big solutions in a big year to get people back to work; to get this debt crisis under control; to get higher take-home pay; to create more jobs. We're going to be offering an agenda of economic growth, of opportunity, as a stark contrast to where we are right now."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
