Marco Rubio today made the following statement on Barack Obama's failed leadership in foreign affairs:<p>"During his 2008 campaign, President Obama offered worrying glimpses into how he would handle foreign policy and, four years later, he's been a dream come true for tyrants and strongmen around the world as they repress innocent people, weaken democratic institutions, and advance their agendas at our expense. For the sake of the United States' interests and the security of our allies, we can't afford four more years of President Obama's indecision, alienation of our allies, and blind faith that cruel and evil tyrants will eventually change their ways if we play nice and wait long enough.<p>"Every day, we see mounting evidence of President Obama's leadership failure on foreign affairs: Hugo Chavez keeps helping Iran further its network in Latin America, Daniel Ortega is settling in to an unconstitutional third term in Nicaragua, the Castro regime enriches itself&nbsp;with American dollars, Assad keeps toying with the world and massacring innocent Syrians, and the Russians and Chinese keep showing us why the President's blind faith in the UN has harmed our interests.&nbsp; Just yesterday, the Chair of the Senate's&nbsp;Intelligence Committee on which I serve chastised the Obama White House for its brazen leaks of sensitive information affecting our national security.<p>"The foreign policy vision we&nbsp;heard yesterday from Mitt Romney&nbsp;inspires hope that the days of a strong and resolute America will soon return under a Romney presidency.&nbsp; Mitt Romney's plan for another American&nbsp;Century will return us to a strengthened economy, a strengthened military, and a foreign policy of clarity and resolve."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
