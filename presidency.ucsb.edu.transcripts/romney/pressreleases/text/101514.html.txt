Rob Portman<p><b>Fox and Friends<br>Fox News</b><br><b>July 17, 2012</b><p><b><i>Click <a href="http://youtu.be/WtfpmZcUK3c" target="_blank">Here</a> To Watch To Sen. Rob Portman Discuss President Obama's Misunderstanding of How Small Business Works</i></b><p><b>SEN. ROB PORTMAN: </b>"Well, it's no wonder that the President says 'the private sector is doing fine' and all we need to do is send more money from the taxpayers back to the states so the states can hire more public employees. That's his answer to the economy. And, again, I think it shows that he doesn't get it. He doesn't understand how our economy works. With all due respect to Steve Jobs and all those other folks who make huge successes, there are also millions of Americans out there every day who work very hard in very small businesses just to kind of keep it afloat, to be able to meet payroll. And those folks feel like they've built it themselves, believe me. And, so, that's my concern is that what this President is doing in terms of policies and has done for three and a half years&mdash;which is more regulations, higher taxes, more borrowing, more spending&mdash;policies that make it harder to create a job through his health care policies, his energy policies. This is the reason we're falling behind and the reason that we have unemployment at levels we haven't seen since the Great Depression. And the reason we're not seeing the kind of economic growth that all of us hoped for. So, we need a change. We need a President who, first, gets it, understands that the private sector is what creates jobs and not government."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
