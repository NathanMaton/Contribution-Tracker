One candidate, Newt Gingrich, is a creature of Washington. The other, Mitt Romney, is a conservative businessman who has spent his life building businesses and saving troubled organizations. Americans are looking for a leader to fix our economic problems, not another Washington insider who does not have experience creating jobs &mdash; that is what we have in the White House right now and it is not the solution to our country's difficulties."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
