"They are the backbone of America and play a critical role in ensuring Americans across the country have access to safe and affordable food. The fruit of their labor nourishes the world, and I admire their hard work in harvesting our country's bountiful resources. Our farmers and ranchers also have a critical role in the health of our economy, employing millions of Americans.&nbsp; I'm grateful to have their support in my efforts to turn around the economy and strengthen the middle class."&nbsp;<p>Commissioner Adam Putnam said, "As Florida's Agriculture Commissioner, I'm proud to be supporting Governor Romney's campaign to get this country moving in the right direction again. While agriculture in America has its own set of unique challenges, farmers are looking for a leader in the White House who knows how the private sector works. Throughout the past three and a half years, President Obama has demonstrated in both his rhetoric and his policies that he lacks that understanding. I'm confident that Governor Romney's experience and vision will restore a brighter future for all Americans."<p>Senator Mike Johanns said, "Having served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and represented Nebraskans as both Governor and Senator, I'm familiar with the challenges and opportunities throughout rural America. From ranches to family farms, the heartland helped build this nation and agriculture remains part of the very fabric that binds it together. President Obama's policies have failed to reinvigorate our economy, and even worse, his regulatory overreach stifled growth and cost jobs. Once a man of soaring rhetoric, his words now diminish the labor and sacrifice of all Americans by saying they didn't build their businesses. I grew up on a farm and know that success is not the result of government action, but rather individual initiative and hard work. Mitt Romney understands the power of free enterprise and its ability to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit. As president, he will not only jumpstart economic growth in this country, but also carefully tend to the needs of agricultural producers and rural communities."<p>Former USDA Deputy Secretary Charles Conner said, "I was raised on a family farm, and having policies which help agriculture thrive is close to my heart. That's one of the reasons why I'm supporting Mitt Romney. The task of turning around our economy so it works for all Americans will not be an easy one, but I'm confident Governor Romney will deliver. Having spent most of his career in the private sector, he knows why President Obama's policies have ill-served economic growth and the jobs that only free enterprise can create."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey said, "Here in Iowa, farmers form a key role in powering our economy. Over the course of the past three and a half years, President Obama hasn't made good on the promises of his campaign four years ago, and the impact of his economic policies has been devastating throughout the country. The need for a new direction and fresh leadership in the White House could not be clearer, and I believe Mitt Romney will provide both."<h4><b>National Chairs</b></h4><p>Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam<br />Ambassador Tom Nassif<br />Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey<br />Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner James Comer<br />Sen.
