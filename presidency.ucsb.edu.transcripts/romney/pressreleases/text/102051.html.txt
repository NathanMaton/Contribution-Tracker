But nearly four years later, it's clear President Obama hasn't lived up to his promise. Millions of Americans are struggling to find work and make ends meet in the Obama economy – and the President's only solution is to distract voters from his inability to get things done. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will finally change Washington and deliver real results to help middle-class families" – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman <h4><b>At A 2008 Event In Fort Collins, Candidate Obama Promised To Abandon The Same Attacks "Used Every Election To Divide Us":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In Fort Collins In 2008: "We Don't Have The Luxury Of Relying On The Same Political Nonsense, The Same Flash And Burn Tactics Used Every Election To Divide Us..." </b>OBAMA: "We don't have the luxury of relying on the same political nonsense, the same flash and burn tactics used every election to divide us, to make us afraid of one another.

I don't think that Governor Romney is somehow responsible for the death of the woman that was portrayed in that ad. But keep in mind, this is an ad I didn't approve, I did not produce, and as far as I can tell, [had] barely run. I think it ran once."
