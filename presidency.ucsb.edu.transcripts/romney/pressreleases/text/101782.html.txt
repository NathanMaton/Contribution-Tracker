   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama may believe his economic policies 'worked' &mdash; but today's disappointing employment report shows otherwise with unemployment on the rise in 44 out of 50 states. His policies have left the middle class struggling with higher unemployment, more debt, and smaller paychecks. As president, Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth policies that create 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for middle-class families." &mdash; Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama Has Claimed His Economic Policies Have "Worked":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama: "We Tried Our Plan &mdash; And It Worked.
