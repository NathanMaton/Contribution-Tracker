As president, Mitt Romney will enact a pro-growth agenda that gets our economy back on track and allows our small businesses and job creators to thrive." –Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama Has Promised To Create New Jobs – But He Still Hasn't Lived Up To His First Jobs Promise:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama's Advisers Predicted The Stimulus Would Lower Unemployment To 6% Today – But It Remains Above 8%.</b> (Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, "<a href="http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/The_Job_Impact_of_the_American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Plan.pdf" target="_blank">The Job Impact Of The American Recovery And Reinvestment Plan</a>," 1/9/09)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Under President Obama, The Nation Has Lost 552,000 Jobs.</b> (Bureau Of Labor Statistics, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">www.bls.gov</a>, 6/4/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>More Than Twenty-Three Million Americans Are Unemployed, Underemployed, Or Have Stopped Looking For Work.</b> (Bureau Of Labor Statistics, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">www.bls.gov</a>, Accessed 6/4/12)<h4><b>And The "Nation's Job Picture Dimmed" Last Month With Increasing Unemployment And Disappointing Job Growth:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Last Month, "The Nation's Jobs Picture Dimmed" With Unemployment Increasing To 8.2%. </b>"The nation's jobs picture dimmed in May as employers added just 69,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2 percent, a continuation of a long, slow employment recovery that began 33 months ago."
