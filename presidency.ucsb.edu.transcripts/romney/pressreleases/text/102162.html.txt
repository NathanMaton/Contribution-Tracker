Guess what? That's exactly what Mitt Romney is." – Paul Ryan <p><b>Remarks</b> <p><b>Richmond, VA</b> <p><b>August 31, 2012</b> <p style="margin-left:.5in;"><b><i>Click </i></b><b><i><a href="http://youtu.be/w2o-djgGswI">Here</a> To Watch Paul Ryan</i></b> <p><b>PAUL RYAN: </b>"Now the President was asked recently, looking back these last four years, any mistakes made, any -- any doubts or regrets? He said, yeah, I haven't communicated enough. I need to tell the American people a story -- as if that's our problem. He needs to talk more and we need to be better listeners?&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen, our problem is that we have not heard enough words in the White House. Our problem is that we had not had enough leadership in the White House. These are trying times. We are at the proverbial fork in the road. We've got a choice of two futures. And what you need in a moment like this, when our economy is in doubt; when a debt crisis looms on our horizon like it's plaguing Europe; when we know, without a shred of a doubt, that our children are going to get a diminished future if we stay on the current path -- moments like this, you need leadership, you need principled leaders. Guess what? That's exactly what Mitt Romney is." <p>&nbsp;</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
