Whether hiding lobbyists in coffee shops, cutting back-room deals on Obamacare, or concealing the records of 'Fast and Furious,' President Obama's pledge to be transparent has turned out to be just another broken promise. With no rationale for reelection and no plan to help middle-class Americans, President Obama has resorted to running a campaign of distraction, distortion and dishonesty." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>After Slamming The Use Of Executive Privilege During His 2008 Campaign, President Obama Is Now Using It To Avoid Telling Americans The Truth About Operation "Fast And Furious":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>With His Attorney General Facing Contempt Of Congress Charges, President Obama Invoked Executive Privilege To Avoid Public Disclosure.</b> "Just as the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was about to vote Eric H.

But what we will do is, we'll have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents, and who are making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies.
