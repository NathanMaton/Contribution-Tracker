   </div></div><span class="displaytext">South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis made the following statement following tonight's debate:<p>"What was clear tonight is that we need a reliable leader with a lifetime of leadership experience, not another president who spent his life in politics. Mitt Romney will lead our country down a different path than the continued failure pursued by our current administration. With unemployment near ten percent in South Carolina, our state cannot afford more big-spending, job-killing policies from this administration. Mitt Romney will cut spending, lessen the regulatory burden, and create an environment that will allow businesses to grow and hire. I urge South Carolinians to get to the polls on Saturday and vote for Mitt Romney - it will be a vote for change in Washington."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
