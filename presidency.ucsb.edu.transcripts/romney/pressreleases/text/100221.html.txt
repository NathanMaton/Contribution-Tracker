"President Obama came into office with no job-creation experience and the failures of the last three years have been the result. These leaders from Louisiana support my bold pro-growth plan for our country's economy that will put Louisianans back to work and I am proud to have their support."<p>"Louisiana conservatives are supporting Mitt Romney because he is the only candidate who can defeat President Obama and put in place conservative, pro-growth policies that will fix our economy," said State Senator Conrad Appel. "In order to repeal Obamacare, cut spending, and reduce burdensome regulation, we must have a proven, conservative leader with a record of results. That is why I support Mitt Romney and why so many in Louisiana are supporting his campaign."<p><b>Louisiana Leaders Supporting Mitt Romney:</b><p>Jefferson Parish President John Young<br>Senator Conrad Appel<br>Senator Danny Martiny<br>Representative Tony Ligi<br>Representative Franklin Foil<br>Representative Joe Harrison<br>Representative Kirk Talbot<br>Representative Tim Burns<br>Representative Joseph Lopinto<br>PSC Commissioner Eric Skrmetta<br>Former Jefferson Parish Council At-Large Diane Hollis<br>Jefferson Parish Tax Assessor Tom Capella<br>Scott Sewell<p><b>Louisiana Leaders Who Have Previously Endorsed Mitt Romney:</b><p>Congressman Rodney Alexander<br>Lt.
