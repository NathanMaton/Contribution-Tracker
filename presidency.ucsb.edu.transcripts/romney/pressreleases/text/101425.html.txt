But these attacks weren't true then, and they're not true now. Americans deserve a president they can trust, and not someone willing to say and do anything to win an election." &mdash;Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Nonpartisan Fact-Checkers Have Again Debunked The Obama Campaign's False Attacks On Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>, On The Subject Of The Latest Obama Campaign Attack: "It Really Feels Like Groundhog Day Again." </b>"But now the Boston Globe has raised the issue again. ...

BOYD: "Bottom line, jobs are the top issue this election, and many voters are worried about the loss of American jobs to overseas companies, which is why the Obama campaign is spending millions of dollars to convince us Mitt Romney is part of the problem. Problem is: these ads don't bear that out. I'm Shaun Boyd and that's 'Reality Check.'"
