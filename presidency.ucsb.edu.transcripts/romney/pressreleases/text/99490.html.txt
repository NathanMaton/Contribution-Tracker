"With the help of my team, we will defeat President Obama, repeal Obamacare, cut government spending, and bring jobs back and turn around our economy."<p>"Mitt Romney is the one conservative candidate who will be able to defeat President Obama in November and bring real change to Washington &mdash; that is why he is supported by so many conservative Georgians," said former Attorney General Mike Bowers. "On the most pressing issue to our state and country, jobs and the economy, Mitt Romney possesses greater knowledge and experience than the other candidates combined. Georgians can be confident that if Mitt Romney is elected, they will have a president who will get Washington out of the way of job creation and personal freedom."<p><b>Georgia Current and Former Elected Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Former Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers<p>Georgia Representative Tom Weldon<p>Douglas County School Board Member Janet Kelley<p><b>Georgia Elected Officials and Leaders Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Attorney General Sam Olens<p>Former House Speaker Mark Burkhalter<p>State Senator Cecil Staton, Majority Whip<p>State Senator Bill Hamrick, Chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee<p>State Senator Fran Millar<p>State Senator Johnny Grant<p>State Senator Greg Goggans<p>State Senator Jeff Mullis<p>State Representative &amp; House Majority Whip Edward Lindsey<p>State Representative Calvin Hill, Vice Chairman of House Appropriations Committee<p>State Representative Wendell Willard, Chairman of House Judiciary Committee<p>State Representative Bruce Williamson<p>State Representative B.J.
