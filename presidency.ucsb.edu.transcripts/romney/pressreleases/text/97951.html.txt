Now, President Obama's campaign is desperate not to talk about the economy. Their strategy is to wage a personal campaign – or 'kill Romney.' It is a campaign of distraction. Now, the tables have turned – President Obama and his campaign are doing exactly what candidate Obama criticized. President Obama and his team don't want to talk about the economy and have tried to distract voters from President Obama's abysmal economic record. Just a few months ago, President Obama's top White House adviser and former campaign manager David Plouffe said Americans don't care about 'unemployment rates or even monthly jobs numbers.' For the next year, this election is going to be a referendum on President Obama's record. Every single day, like millions of Americans, we are going to talk about President Obama's historic failure, and the need to get America back on track. Just because he won't take responsibility doesn't mean the American people won't hold him accountable. President Obama will have to confront the promises made by candidate Obama."
