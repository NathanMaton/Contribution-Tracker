"Government doesn't create jobs, the private sector does," he says repeatedly on the campaign trail. He has put forth a tax plan that lowers the top corporate tax rate and cuts 20 percent off marginal rates for individuals, ideas he hopes will create jobs.<p>"We've got to have more jobs, less debt and smaller government, they go together," Romney said in an appearance in Chandler, Ariz., earlier this week. "By lowering those marginal rates, we help businesses that pay at the individual tax rate to have more money so they can hire more people."<p>He has also said that he will work to ease the debt burden on the U.S., which under the Obama administration has been increasing at more than $1.3 trillion a year.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
