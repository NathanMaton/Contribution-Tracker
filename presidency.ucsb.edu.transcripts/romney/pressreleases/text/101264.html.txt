Haven't found any. My unemployment benefits did run out and we're just trying to get by."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>CLAUSEN:</b> "There's two things in this world I care about.

He hates it. Because he grew up in that mentality that you don't get unemployment. You don't live off the government. You do everything, you pay for everything your own way. My neighbor across the street's the same way. I end up going over and helping Damon in Iowa Falls, he's a good friend of mine. He does moving and storage, and then I help him dig graves on the side. But I've probably dug a couple hundred graves."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>CLAUSEN:</b> "The Des Moines Register reporter was there.

It's going to get tougher I think."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>KNAPP:</b> "That's the problem. A lot of people around here when Barack, ya know, was running and all that. Everyone believed, everyone had hope. They all thought 'man, this guy's gonna get something done.'"<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>KNAPP:</b> "When he is in office now it just seems like nothing's getting done. It seems like it's all talk. You can say whatever you want. But it's not about saying what everyone wants to hear, it's about doing it."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VOICEOVER:</b> "Hope and change has not been kind to millions of Americans, but they still believe in this great country, and deserve a leader who believes in them: Mitt Romney."<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>RAGLAND:</b> "So we're just going to sit tight and see how things go, and see if the next president turns it around."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
