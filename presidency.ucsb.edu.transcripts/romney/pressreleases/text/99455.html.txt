But I think once the sunlight gets focused on Rick Santorum's record of more spending, more earmarks, the raising of the debt ceiling, that's when these candidates tend to fade. The reality is Rick Santorum has no executive experience. He endorsed Arlen Specter for President of the United States. And there's a reason why the people of Pennsylvania rejected him by beating him by 18 percentage points. He did not support Pat Toomey for instance who was by far the more conservative person in the race. And when that gets a little bit more exposed, a little bit more sunshine on it, I think you'll start to see people gravitate back towards what is the strength for Mitt Romney, which is jobs, the economy, and his conservative outside Washington, D.C. experience that's going to compel him to the nomination and becoming the President of the United States."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
