"I'm happy to earn their endorsement and look forward to working with them for the vote of every South Carolinian."<p>"The voters of South Carolina have an important choice to make regarding the future of this country," said former South Carolina Secretary of Commerce Bob Faith. "We need a conservative candidate who will defeat President Obama and reverse his failed policies. That man is Mitt Romney. He is committed to getting rid of failed government programs like Obamacare. He is against government entities like the NLRB interfering with free enterprises like Boeing who want to invest in South Carolina and create jobs for South Carolinians.&nbsp; He is for restoring conservative principles to government, so that Washington will stop spending and start letting this country's entrepreneurs and business leaders get back to creating jobs."<br />&nbsp;<br />"Our nation is at a crossroads, and Mitt Romney is the best choice to lead our country through these challenging times," said Greenville County Council Chairman and retired Brigadier General Butch Kirven.&nbsp; "He is a strong leader who we can trust to restore limited government to Washington, cut spending, grow our economy, and get our nation back on the right track. I was looking for someone who reflects my values, is strong on national defense, and knows how to get the economy going again.&nbsp; Mitt Romney is the leader who can positively do that, and he can win in November."<br />&nbsp;<br />"It's really simple, the only person of either party running for President who has created significant private sector jobs is Mitt Romney," said retired executive Bill Hewitt. "He will implement the policies necessary to turn the economy around, start of story, end of story."<h4><b>South Carolina Leaders Supporting Mitt Romney:</b></h4><p><b>Upstate</b><br />State Representative Don Bowen, Anderson<br />Greenville County Councilman Joe Dill<br />Greenville City Councilwoman Amy Ryberg Doyle<br />George Dean Johnson, Jr., Chairman, Johnson Development Associates, Spartanburg<br />Greenville County Council Chairman Butch Kirven<br />State Representative Phil Owens, Easley<br />Rick Pennell, Metromont Corporation, Greenville<br />Specialist John Snyder, U.S. Army, Ret., Greenville<br />Greenville Mayor Pro Tempore David Sudduth<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>Midlands</b><br />John H.
