The last thing that President Obama and his campaign want to do is run against Mitt Romney and be held accountable for the economic failures of the last three years. So, instead of trying to create jobs for the middle class, President Obama and his campaign have focused on tearing down Mitt Romney."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
