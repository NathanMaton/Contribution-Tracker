   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"For weeks, President Obama has been spreading falsehoods and distortions about Governor Romney's record of job creation &mdash; and now we know why. President Obama's policies have encouraged American jobs to move overseas and he's sent taxpayer dollars to foreign-owned companies. Sometimes the truth hurts, and it's clear the President's failed economic policies are hurting American workers." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama's Campaign Distortions Have Been Debunked By Nonpartisan Fact Checkers As "Misleading, Unfair And Untrue":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>FactCheck.org: "We Found No Evidence To Support The Claim That Romney &mdash; While He Was Still Running Bain Capital &mdash; Shipped American Jobs Overseas." </b>"But after reviewing numerous corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, contemporary news accounts, company histories and press releases, and the evidence offered by both the Obama and Romney campaigns, we found no evidence to support the claim that Romney &mdash; while he was still running Bain Capital &mdash; shipped American jobs overseas."
