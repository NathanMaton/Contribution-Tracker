The President's budget would have increased the debt to $25 trillion by 2021.&nbsp;He couldn't get one vote for it in the United States Congress. I mean, Soledad, we are in a difficult time for the greatest country on Earth and the President's talking about issues that really don't resonate with the people. And I think what&nbsp;Paul Ryan brings to the ticket is now a serious conversation about debt, taxes, spending, energy, entitlement reform. These are the things that will determine what kind of country we've got for our kids and our grandkids.&nbsp;They need to be talked about and Paul Ryan is a good guy to do it. So I think independent voters when they realize that we have these serious problems will say, yes, we do need to make some changes and this is the team to do it because the status quo with Biden and Obama is unacceptable."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
