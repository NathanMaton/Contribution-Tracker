There are millions of stories from the Obama economy that reflect his failure to make things better. Too many Americans have lost their jobs, lost their homes, and fallen into poverty under this president. They are tired of being tired. They want good jobs, rising incomes, and hope for a better tomorrow. They want to believe in America again. And that is what this campaign is going to be about." – Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director<h4><b>President Obama Has Doubled Down On His Campaign's Widely-Repudiated Attacks On Governor Romney's Business Career:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>This Week, President Obama Said His Attacks On Governor Romney Are "What This Campaign's Going To Be About."</b> "President Obama Monday defended his campaign's attacks on Mitt Romney's business record, denying that they are a distraction or a side issue.
