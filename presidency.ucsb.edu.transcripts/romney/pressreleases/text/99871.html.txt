Santorum friends and former Republican associates there say that as a U.S. senator, he astonished them by lobbying for a boost in the sales tax in 11 southwestern Pennsylvania counties to pay for building a new stadium for the Pittsburgh Steelers and another new stadium for the Pittsburgh Pirates."

Mr. Santorum then backed a move to have the state legislature provide the money." (Ralph Z.

In a 1997 opinion column that Mr. Santorum wrote for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, he attempted to justify his position. 'My support for the half-cent sales tax in southwestern Pennsylvania has provoked criticism, consternation and speculation,' he wrote. 'Contrary to what my critics have suggested, I am not another Republican gone soft. I am not a convert to tax-and-spend policies.'" (Ralph Z.

I Just Couldn't Understand..."</b> "'It was a sweetheart deal for the two teams, a total taxpayer giveaway,' Larry Dunn, who was a Republican and the commission chairman of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. Mr. Dunn helped lead a coalition of conservatives to defeat the proposed tax increase. 'I just couldn't understand how Rick could have supported this big-government position and claim to be a fiscal conservative,' Mr. Dunn said." (Ralph Z.

'I didn't and still don't understand how Rick Santorum could back the plan to assess an added one-cent sales tax on all working people of Allegheny County and the surrounding nine counties to do what? To build two new stadiums to benefit the owners of privately held, for-profit sports teams,' said Mrs. Meloy, who served in the Reagan White House." (Ralph Z.
