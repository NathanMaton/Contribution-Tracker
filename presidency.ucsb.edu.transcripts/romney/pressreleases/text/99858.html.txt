"It is imperative that we put in place policies that will reverse the failures of the last three years. I recently laid out my vision for creating jobs and shrinking government &mdash; with the help of this team and the support of Washingtonians we will be able to bring lasting, conservative change to Washington."<p>"Mitt Romney has laid out an economic plan that is being supported by conservatives in Washington because it is bold, comprehensive and will put Washingtonians back to work," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "The strong team that the campaign has put together in Washington is a sign that Mitt Romney is the candidate that conservatives are looking to in order to defeat President Obama and put in place policies that will allow job-creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs to thrive."<h4><b>STATE & REGIONAL CHAIRS:</b></h4><p>Washington State Chair Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers<br>Washington State Co-Chair former US Attorney Mike McKay<br>Washington State Co-Chair former State Senator Dino Rossi<br>Co-Vice Chair: Eastern Washington Mary Dye<br>Co-Vice Chair: Eastern Washington former State Rep Dale Foreman<br>Co-Vice Chair: Western Washington Rob McCallum<br>Co-Vice Chair: Western Washington Diane Tebelius<br>Honorary Chair former Governor & US Senator Dan Evans<br>Grassroots coordinator Jeff McMorris&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4><b>CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CHAIRS:</b></h4><p>1st CD Chair Natalie Lavering<br>1st CD Steering Committee Chair Dullain Ehrlich<br>2nd CD Chair Mary Jane Olson<br>3rd CD co-Chair Senator Don Benton<br>3rd CD co-Chair Representative Paul Harris<br>4th CD co-Chair Dr. Rob Merrill<br>4th CD co-Chair David Hedengren<br>5th CD co-Chair Frankie DeWitt<br>5th CD co-Chair Bill Hyslop<br>7th CD Chair David Nelson<br>8th CD co-Chair Bob Brunjes<br>8th CD co-Chair Representative Jay Rodne<br>9th CD Chair Tricia Richards<br>9th CD -- honorary Chair Bellevue Mayor Conrad Lee<br>10th CD Chair Alex Hays<br>10th CD -- honorary Chair Representative JT Wilcox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4><b>COUNTY CHAIRS:</b></h4><p>Clark County co-Chair Stephanie McClintock<br>Clark County co-Chair Justin Riley<br>Clark County co-Chair Greg Kimsey<br>Cowlitz County Chair Heidi Shaw<br>Franklin County Chair Stephanie Swanberg<br>Garfield County Chair Roger & Mary Dye<br>Grant County Chair Dr. David Earl<br>King County Chair &mdash; northern Randy Eastwood<br>Kittitas County Chair State Representative Bill Hinkle<br>Pend Oreille County Chair Wayne Antcliff<br>Pierce County -- East Side County, Matt Hamilton<br>Pierce County -- West Side County, Don Anderson, Lakewood Deputy Mayor<br>Skagit County Chair - 1st CD, April Axthem<br>Snohomish County Chair Bob Williams<br>Spokane County Chair Beva Miles<br>Wahkiakum County Chair Ross Kolditz<br>Walla Walla County Chair Lisa Wagner<br>Whatcom County Chair Darin Holman<br>Yakima County Chair Jon DeVaney<br>Yakima County Chair -- lower valley LaDon Linde&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4><b>LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT CHAIRS:</b></h4><p>1st LD co-Chair Diana Davis<br>1st LD co-Chair Eva Davies<br>2nd LD (east Pierce County) Matt Hamilton<br>4th LD Diana Wilhite<br>6th LD Dwight Calkins<br>7th LD, rural areas, Ben Carpenter<br>7th LD, urban areas, Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich<br>9th LD Jeff Olson<br>10th LD Meledie Knopf<br>21st LD Alan Tagle<br>25th LD co-chair Rose Hill<br>25th LD co-chair former State Representative Dave Morrell<br>30th LD Maureen Bernardy<br>31st LD Dave Enslow<br>32nd LD Paul Hess<br>36th LD Nicole Franklin<br>38th LD Kurt Hanke<br>39th LD co-Chair Kenton Gidewall<br>39th LD co-Chair Diane McAllister<br>41st LD co-Chair Michelle Hilhorst<br>41st LD co-Chair Mark Griswold<br>44th LD Reggie Wight<br>45th LD co-chair Toby Nixon<br>45th LD co-chair Trina Wilbur<br>46th LD Warren Peterson<br>48th LD co-chair Bruce Hand<br>48th LD co-chair Dave Elliott&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4><b>CITY CHAIRS:</b></h4><p>Arlington, Dawn Dickson<br>Bothell co-chair, Karen King<br>Bothell co-chair Kevin Gleed<br>Duvall/Carnation, Rob Millard<br>Everett co-Chair, Heather Hainline<br>Everett co-Chair, Aaron Wright<br>Granite Falls, Rene McKervey<br>Kenmore, Randy Eastwood<br>Kirkland, Claudia Bennett<br>Lake Stevens co-Chair, Alex Glaves<br>Lake Stevens co-Chair, Kerry Goodwin<br>Lynden City, Dirk Bybee<br>Marysville co-Chair, Karen Clayton<br>Marysville co-Chair, Brent Ward<br>Redmond, David Carson<br>Snohomish (city) co-Chair, Jen Stallings<br>Snohomish (city) co-Chair, Alicia Kersavage<br>Tacoma, Beth (Jensen) & Jim Chew<br>Woodinville co-chair, Karen Clayton<br>Woodinville co-chair, Brent Ward</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
