"Congresswoman Hayworth has prioritized creating jobs and getting government spending under control. I hope, as president, to work with Nan to ensure that our children and grandchildren will not be the ones to shoulder trillions of dollars in debt they had no part in creating." <p>"14 million Americans need jobs," said Congresswoman Nan Hayworth. "That's why we have to fix our economy. Mitt Romney has proven as a governor and as a business leader that he can turn around tough situations and make things work. I have complete confidence in his ability to balance the federal budget, make the government efficient and effective, and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity they deserve and the prosperity they need. Mitt Romney is the right person to get us back to work, and he will make an outstanding president." <p><b>Background On Congresswoman Hayworth:</b> <p>A doctor, mother, and businesswoman, congresswoman Nan Hayworth represents New York's 19th district.
