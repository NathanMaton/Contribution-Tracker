"This level of support shows that my message of restoring fiscal sanity to Washington is resonating with voters across the country. These supporters will be crucial in helping me spread my message of creating jobs and cutting spending in the months to come."<p>"It is an honor to announce these additions to Mitt Romney's growing team in Idaho," said Governor Butch Otter. "These last three years have seen unacceptably high unemployment and home values that have fallen, all while the middle class is getting crushed.
