Why Is The Federal Government Even In The Pension Program...? Let The States Do It."</b> PERRY: "When you look at Social Security, it's broke. ... Get it back to the states. Why is the federal government even in the pension program or the health care delivery program? Let the states do it. ... That, I will suggest to you, is one of the ways this federal government can get out of our business, save a lot of money and get back to that Constitutional way of doing business in those enumerated powers that they're supposed to have."

Whether it's Social Security, whether it's Medicaid, whether it's Medicare. You've got $115 trillion worth of unfunded liability in those three. ... And I think we should have a legitimate, honest, national discussion about Washington's continuing to spend money we don't have on programs that we don't need."
