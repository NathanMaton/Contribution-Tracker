I Told Them I Was Put Out Of A Job. I Want To Know Why."</b> BOBBY STRICKLAND: I didn't see it coming. If they saw it coming no one said anything about it. I was there for only a short time. I was gung-ho, I was a contract employee and due to go permanent a couple weeks after everything had happened. So I didn't see it coming at all. ... I want to know why I'm behind on my bills now? Sallie Mae wants to know why they are not going to get their loan for this month and maybe next month. I have to tell them something. I told them I was put out of a job. I want to know why."
