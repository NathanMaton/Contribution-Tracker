   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Pennsylvania Congressman Jim Gerlach made the following statement on Pennsylvania's upcoming primary on April 24:<p>"After a long and grueling primary, Mitt Romney has proven to the nation that he is the best candidate to defeat President Obama, and the best leader to fix our economy and get the country back on track. I have been a strong supporter of Mitt for months and it is time for Republicans to get behind his candidacy and turn our attention to President Obama's failed record of bloated government, more debt, and high unemployment. On April 24 and again in November, Pennsylvanians can be a part of changing the direction of our country, and ensuring our kids and grandkids have a brighter future by electing Mitt Romney as President. I urge Pennsylvanians to support him."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
