The July jobs report marks the 42nd straight month that the unemployment rate has been above 8%. The Obama Administration's failed economic policies of over-regulation and tax hikes continue to disproportionately hurt Hispanics, who suffer from 10.3% unemployment &mdash; even worse than the national rate. Mitt Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will revive our economy, creating 12 million jobs in his first term while restoring the confidence of small business owners and job creators everywhere."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
