As a new member of Congress in the Reagan years &mdash; and I was an assistant secretary of state &mdash; Mr. Gingrich voted with the president regularly, but equally often spewed insulting rhetoric at Reagan, his top aides, and his policies to defeat Communism. Gingrich was voluble and certain in predicting that Reagan's policies would fail, and in all of this he was dead wrong.<br>...<p>Here at home, we faced vicious criticism from leading Democrats &mdash; Ted Kennedy, Christopher Dodd, Jim Wright, Tip O'Neill, and many more &mdash; who used every trick in the book to stop Reagan by denying authorities and funds to these efforts. On whom did we rely up on Capitol Hill? There were many stalwarts: Henry Hyde, elected in 1974; Dick Cheney, elected in 1978, the same year as Gingrich; Dan Burton and Connie Mack, elected in 1982; and Tom DeLay, elected in 1984, were among the leaders.<p>But not Newt Gingrich. He voted with the caucus, but his words should be remembered, for at the height of the bitter struggle with the Democratic leadership Gingrich chose to attack . . . Reagan.<p>The best examples come from a famous floor statement Gingrich made on March 21, 1986.<br>...<p>Here is Gingrich: "Measured against the scale and momentum of the Soviet empire's challenge, the Reagan administration has failed, is failing, and without a dramatic change in strategy will continue to fail. . . . President Reagan is clearly failing."<br>...<p>Such was Gingrich's faith in President Reagan that in 1985, he called Reagan's meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev "the most dangerous summit for the West since Adolf Hitler met with Neville Chamberlain in 1938 in Munich."<br>...<p>In Afghanistan, Reagan's policy was marked by "impotence [and] incompetence." Thus Gingrich concluded as he surveyed five years of Reagan in power that "we have been losing the struggle with the Soviet empire." Reagan did not know what he was doing, and "it is precisely at the vision and strategy levels that the Soviet empire today is superior to the free world."<br>...<p>The second point to make is that Gingrich made these assaults on the Reagan administration just as Democratic attacks were heating up unmercifully. Far from becoming a reliable voice for Reagan policy and the struggle against the Soviets, Gingrich took on Reagan and his administration. It appears to be a habit: He did the same to George W. Bush when Bush was making the toughest and most controversial decision of his presidency &mdash; the surge in Iraq.<br>...<p>Bush on the surge and Reagan on the Soviet empire were tough, courageous &mdash; and right. Newt Gingrich in retrospect seems less the visionary than the politician who refused the party's leader loyal support on grounds that history has proved were simply wrong.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
