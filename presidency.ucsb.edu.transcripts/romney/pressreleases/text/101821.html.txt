He also said you could go out and build a new coal plant if you want, but if you do you will go bankrupt. That's another promise he's intent on keeping. His vice president said coal is more dangerous than terrorists. Can you imagine that? This tells you precisely what he actually feels and what he's done. And his policies over the last three and a half years have put in place the very vision he had when he was running for office. But now he wants to get reelected. And he knows to do so, he's got to win Ohio. And to win Ohio, he's got to win eastern Ohio, and he's got to get the votes of the people in these communities all around us here and you're not going to let that happen because you're going to keep our jobs, you're going to keep Ohio strong and bring back America."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
