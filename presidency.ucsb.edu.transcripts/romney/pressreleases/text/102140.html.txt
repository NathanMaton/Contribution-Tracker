Worse yet, the President falsely alleged no one in his campaign had accused Mitt Romney of committing a crime. President Obama's failure to stand up to dishonest rhetoric and attacks demonstrates yet again he's diminished the office that he holds and his record is nothing more than business as usual in Washington." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman <h4><b>President Obama Ducked Another Call To Condemn His Super PAC – But Candidate Obama Claimed He Was Willing To "Walk The Walk" On Condemning Outside Groups:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Today, President Obama Again Ducked Calls To Condemn His Super PAC's Disgraceful Attack On Mitt Romney. </b>CORDES: "But why not send a message to the top Super PAC that's supporting you and say I think an ad like that is out of bounds?

I don't think that Governor Romney is somehow responsible for the death of the woman that was portrayed in that ad.

You can't say yesterday, you don't believe in 'em, and today, you're having three-quarters of a million dollars being spent for you. You can't just talk the talk. The easiest thing is to talk about change during an election time. Everybody talks about change in an election time. ... My track record is strong on this. I walk the walk."
