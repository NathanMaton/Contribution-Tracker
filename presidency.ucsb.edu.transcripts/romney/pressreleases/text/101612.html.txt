And I would suggest having more meetings like this and with his Jobs Council and maybe with you guys or with his Jobs Council. It's like, 'Why won't he meet with his Jobs Council?' These are some of the largest employers in the country. They have perspectives on what it would take for them to hire people. And why it is they decide to build a facility outside the country as to doing what you've done, which is to grow in this country. The President needs to spend time with the Jobs Council.
