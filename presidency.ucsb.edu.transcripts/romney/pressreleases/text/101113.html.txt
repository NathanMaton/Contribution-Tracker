The President should be more concerned with helping the twenty-three million Americans who are struggling for work. Mitt Romney has the experience and pro-growth plan to promote job creation and get our economy back on track." –Andrea Saul, Romney Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama's Own Former Adviser Called The Ad "Unfair": </b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Former Obama Economic Adviser Stephen Rattner: "I Think The Ad Is Unfair... I Don't Think There's Anything Bain Capital Did That They Need To Be Embarrassed About." </b>"Former Obama administration auto czar Steven Rattner said Monday that the Obama campaign's renewed attack on Mitt Romney's time in private equity was 'unfair.' 'I think the ad is unfair.' Rattner said. 'Mitt Romney made a mistake ever talking about the fact that he created 100,000 jobs.'...'Bain Capital's responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs or some other number. It was to create profits for its investors,' Rattner said. 'It did it superbly well, acting within the rules, acting very responsibly,' Rattner said. 'This is part of capitalism, this is part of life. I don't think there's anything Bain Capital did that they need to be embarrassed about.'"
