"Tom has been a wonderful leader for Pennsylvania and shares my values of spurring economic security through scaling back the size of government and promoting pro-growth policies. There is no doubt that Pennsylvania will be a crucial state in November. With Tom's help, I know that I will be able to share my vision of restoring American greatness to Pennsylvania voters."<p>"Now that the long primary season has ended, it is time for Republicans to come together and unite around the one candidate who can defeat Barack Obama and institute a bold conservative vision that we need in Washington," said Governor Tom Corbett.
