   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Four years ago today, Candidate Obama promised an economy that would finally work for the middle class. But after nearly four years in office, President Obama still hasn't delivered and middle-class families are struggling with fewer jobs, lower incomes, higher poverty, and skyrocketing costs. The President's policies have disappointed those who needed him most. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are offering a very different vision and a better future with 12 million new jobs and more take-home pay." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago Today, Candidate Obama Criticized An Economy That Was "Not Working For Ordinary People" And Promised A Better Future:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, Four Years Ago Today: "We Are At A Tough Time Right Now In This His Country ... We Have Seen An Economy That Is Not Working For Ordinary People." </b>OBAMA: "But the other thing I've learned as I've traveled across the country is, is that that American dream feels like it's slipping away. You know? We are at a tough time right now in this his country, and I don't have to tell people here. You know, we have seen an economy that is not working for ordinary people." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks, Billings, MT, 8/27/08) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama: "Record Number Of Home Foreclosures ...&nbsp; People Not Being Able To Fill Up Their Gas Tanks. ... Young People Having The Grades To Go To College But Not Having The Money." </b>OBAMA: "Manufacturing keeps shutting down. We have record number of home foreclosures, the most since any time since the Great Depression. Family bankruptcies. People not being able to pay for health care. People not being able to fill up their gas tanks. Seniors who try to figure out how they're going to pay their home heating this winter. Young people having the grades to go to college but not having the money." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks, Billings, MT, 8/27/08) <h4><b>But Four Years Later, The Middle Class Isn't Better Off – Millions Of Americans Are Struggling To Find Work And Make Ends Meet:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>More Than Twenty-Three Million Americans Are Unemployed, Underemployed, Or Have Stopped Looking For Work.</b>&nbsp;(Bureau Of Labor Statistics,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">www.bls.gov</a>, 8/26/12) <ul> <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><b>Since President Obama Took Office, The Nation Has Lost 316,000 Jobs And The Unemployment Rate Has Remained Above 8% For 42 Straight Months. </b>(Bureau Of Labor Statistics, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">www.bls.gov</a>, 8/26/12)</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"Almost 5.2 Million Americans Have Been Out Of Work For At Least Six Months." </b>(Jeff Kearn, "U.S. Incomes Fell More In Recovery, Sentier Says," <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-23/u-s-incomes-feel-more-in-recovery-sentier-says.html" target="_blank"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>, 8/23/12) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office Has Projected "The Unemployment Rate Will Stay Above 8 Percent For The Rest Of The Year."</b> "The unemployment rate will stay above 8 percent for the rest of the year, CBO estimates, and the rate of inflation in consumer prices will remain low."
