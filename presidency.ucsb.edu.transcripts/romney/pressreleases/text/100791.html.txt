If this is a 'proud' record for the President, Americans truly can't afford another four more years of Barack Obama." -Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Last Week, President Obama Claimed He Was "Proud" Of His Record On Women's Issues:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Last Week, President Obama Claimed He Was "Proud" Of His Record On Behalf Of Women. </b>OBAMA: "So I've got a vested interest in making sure women do well.&nbsp; And I'm proud of what we've done on behalf of women across this country.&nbsp; I know you've heard a lot about that today.&nbsp; But I want you to know why we've done what we've done -- because there are values behind the policies."
