President Obama's tax increases on families and job creators will create more economic uncertainty and fewer opportunities for struggling middle-class families. From Day One, Mitt Romney will take action to lower marginal rates, help middle-class Americans save and invest, and jumpstart economic growth and job creation." &mdash;Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama's Economy Is Stuck In Neutral, Causing Many Experts To Worry About A "Zombie Economy":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>CNBC Headline: "Signs We Are Approaching A Zombie Economy" </b>(Patti Domm, "Signs We Are Approaching A Zombie Economy," <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/48096924">CNBC</a>, 7/6/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"The American Job Machine Has Jammed" And Has Settled Into A "Summer Slump For The Third Year In A Row." </b>"The American job machine has jammed.

It would thus favor big corporations at the expense of smaller businesses that file as individuals and would see their marginal rate rise to 41% or more under Mr. Obama's plan to raise individual tax rates."
