More Wrong Than Right."</b> "By PolitiFact's reckoning, Mr. Gingrich has strayed from the facts most often. PolitiFact found more wrong than right in a majority of Mr. Gingrich's statements that they graded. That is to say, 59 percent of Mr. Gingrich's grades fell on the bottom half of the scale (pants on fire, false and mostly false)." (Micah Cohen, "Another Check On The Campaign's Truthiness," <i>The New York Times</i>' "Five Thirty Eight" Blog, 1/27/12)<h4><b>ON BALANCED BUDGETS:</b></h4><p><b>Gingrich: "When I Was Speaker, We Had Four Consecutive Balanced Budgets..."</b> GINGRICH: "Well, first of all, the case I make is that, when I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets, the only time in your lifetime, Brian, that we've had four consecutive balanced budgets. Most people think that's good." (GOP Presidential Candidates Debate, Tampa, FL, 1/23/12)<ul><li style="margin-left: 0.25in; "><b>Gingrich "Can Plausibly Claim Credit For" Two Balanced Budgets &mdash; Not Four.</b> "During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 &mdash; the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker &mdash; there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 &mdash; which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year &mdash; it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that's only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for."

But we found solid evidence he did, with the condition that carbon caps be combined with tax incentives to encourage energy companies to innovate. He told Frontline a cap and trade system combined with tax incentives is 'something I would strongly support,' and even [said] the country 'would be much better off' if cap and trade had been instituted. That's favoring it. We rate his statement False."
