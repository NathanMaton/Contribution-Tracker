   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced the support of North Dakota statewide elected officials. He also announced his grassroots volunteer team.<p>"It is an honor to have such an overwhelming number of supporters on our team in North Dakota, and I want to thank Senator John Hoeven and his wife Mikey Hoeven for serving as honorary co-chairs of our growing team," said Mitt Romney. "These leaders understand that President Obama's policies are not helping North Dakota. With their hard work, we can make sure that Washington gets out of the way of states like North Dakota so they can develop their energy resources and create an environment for businesses to expand and hire."<p>Announcing the additions to Mitt Romney's North Dakota team, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said, "Mitt Romney enjoys widespread support across North Dakota because he is the best candidate to defeat President Obama, put an end to the out of control spending in Washington, and lead an economic turnaround. No other candidate, either in the White House or in the Republican Party, has the lifelong record of successful leadership that Mitt Romney has. At no time in recent history has our country needed a strong leader like Mitt Romney as we do now. That is why I support Mitt Romney and why I urge fellow North Dakotans to support him as well."<p><b>North Dakota Statewide Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem<p>Insurance Commissioner Adam Hamm<p>State Auditor Bob Peterson<p>Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring<p><b>North Dakota State Senators Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Senator Dwight Cook<p>Senator Layton Freborg<p>Senator David Hogue<p>Senator Ray Holmberg<p>Senator Lonnie Laffen<p>Senator Stan Lyson<p>Senator Dave Nething<p>Senator George Nodland<p>Senator Dave Oehlke<p>Senator Ron Sorvaag<p>Senator Judy Lee<p><b>North Dakota House Members Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>Representative Tom Beadle<p>Representative Don Clark<p>Representative Stacey Dahl<p>Representative Bob Frantsvog<p>Representative Kathy Hawken<p>Representative Curt Hofstad<p>Representative Dennis Johnson<p>Representative Nancy Johnson<p>Representative Larry Klemin<p>Representative Andy Maragos<p>Representative Mike Nathe<p>Representative Jon Nelson<p>Representative Mark Owens<p>Representative Mark Sanford<p><b>Grassroots Supporters:</b><p><b>Fargo Area</b><p>Pam Younggren<p>Linn Webb<p>Rob Lindberg<p>Sandy Boehler<p>Margaret Mowery<p>Vicki Fredrickson<p>Bruce Furness<p><b>Grand Forks Devils Lake Area</b><p>Nate Martindale<p>Dan Traynor<p>Susan Shearer<p>Beth Bouley<p>Mae Marie Blackmore<p>Ben and Bev Clayburgh<p>Vonda Markestad<p><b>Bismarck/Minot/Dickinson Area</b><p>Linda and Alan Butts<p>Bob Harms<p>Diane Lillis<p>Yvonne and Gene Kroll<p>Clare and Lisa Carlson<p>Jody Reinke<p>Jim and Nicole Poolman<p>Shari Haugen Hoffart<p>Bill and Bonnie Daniel<p>Karen Kalk<p>Fran Gronberg<p>Marlene Sax<p></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
