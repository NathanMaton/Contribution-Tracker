You've told me about what you like about Mitt Romney and why you got in. Why did you get in with Mitt Romney?"<p>	<b>REP. CONNIE MACK:</b> "I supported him last go around because I just think we need someone who understands the economy and business. You know, this government acts in a way that nobody recognizes, but we know that free markets, free enterprise, capitalism, we know that is what makes America strong. It's that type of mentality that gives us the resources to have the strongest military. It's business and risk-takers that ensures that our freedoms and our liberties can be protected and Mitt Romney has been speaking to this now since last go around. Remember he was the conservative. If you remember that, everybody, you know, four years ago, he's the conservative and McCain was the moderate. So this is just part of the political gamesmanship that happens. I think Mitt Romney is going to deliver a very strong speech here today. He's going to speak not only to the Tea Party folks but also to America and what's important to them and how do we turn this country around."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
