The hugely successful reform saved billions for taxpayers.<p>More importantly, it began to dismantle the culture of dependency that welfare had fostered: two out of three people on welfare went to work or went to school. The President's decision to cater to the radical left wing of his party and undo welfare reform is one more reason why it is critical to defeat him at the polls this November."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
