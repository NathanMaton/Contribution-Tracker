Yost will serve as a Co-Chair of the Romney for President Ohio Leadership Team.<p>"I'm pleased to earn Dave's support," said Mitt Romney. "Dave understands the need for our country to restore our economy and create jobs for the American people. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Dave to spread my message of more jobs, less spending, smaller government."<p>"Ohioans are tired of President Obama's broken promises and failed record," said Auditor Yost. "Three years of out-of-control spending, higher taxes, and Obamacare have put America's fiscal health on life support. We need a conservative candidate who actually knows how to create jobs and balance the budget. That's why I'm supporting Mitt Romney. He's the only candidate who not only has a long track record of fiscal discipline, but also a bold plan to lower taxes, cut spending, and reform entitlements in a responsible way. That's what our country is looking for and that's why I'm confident Mitt's message will connect with Ohio voters."<p><b>Background On Auditor Dave Yost:</b><p>Yost was elected in 2010.
