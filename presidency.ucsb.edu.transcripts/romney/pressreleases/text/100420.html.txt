All too often, he was content to play the same old Washington games by taking one 'for the team' instead of standing on principle. Republicans are looking for a proven leader who can take on Barack Obama and ultimately get our spending, debt, and deficits under control." &mdash;Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Before "Going Washington," Senator Spendtorum Urged His Colleagues To Remember Why They Were Sent To D.C.

(CSPAN's "New Members Roundtable," 12/13/90)<h4><b>After "Going Washington," Senator Spendtorum Abandoned His Pledge To Get Spending Under Control:</b></h4><p><b>Shortly After Arriving In D.C., Santorum Said He Was Willing To "Stand Up And Vote Against Popular Programs Back Home" To Get The Budget Under Control.</b> SANTORUM: "You can talk about all the make-work programs you want, we are going to stifle growth in this country unless we balance this budget and get it under control. And I am &mdash; I will stand up and vote against maybe popular programs back home, but you got to do it because I care about my 9 month daughter, Elizabeth to have the same opportunities and the same America I grew up with."

SANTORUM: "Well, I think the focus again of what the people were telling me during the campaign is that we really need budget reform. We really need to get our situation under control here as far as the deficit. So that is something that I'm principally concerned about."
