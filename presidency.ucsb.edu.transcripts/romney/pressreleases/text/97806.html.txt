"Indiana has not been served well by President Obama. He has failed on his promise to fix the economy and must be held accountable. With the help of these men and women, we will put our country on the right path again." "Mitt Romney is the candidate best suited to meeting the challenges our country faces," said State Senator Jim Merritt. "On the issue with which Americans are most concerned, the economy, there is no other candidate who is better equipped to go toe-to-toe with President Obama, defeat him in November, and restore confidence that America will continue to be the world's most powerful nation." "President Obama's high-spending policies have put us on a path to Greece," said State Representative Heath Van Natter. "Mitt Romney is a conservative businessman – he knows that you can't spend more than you take in. He has proposed policies that will stop the growth of government and allow for the private sector to flourish." Announcing the additional endorsements, Congressman Todd Rokita said, "President Obama has failed Indiana and the rest of the country. Three years ago, he promised to bring change to Washington and to turn around the economy – he has not delivered on these promises. Mitt Romney has the private sector experience that our next president must have to fix the economic mess President Obama has created. Along with these leaders in Indiana, we will work to defeat President Obama in November and ensure that our future is as bright as our past." <b>Indiana Elected Officials And Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney: </b> <ul> <li>Jim Merritt; State Senator</li> <li>Ryan Mishler; State Senator </li> <li>Heath Van Natter; State Representative </li> <li>Mike Karickhoff; State Representative</li> <li>Ed Soliday; State Representative </li> <li>Tim Neese; State Representative</li> <li>Tim Fesko; Former State Representative</li> <li>Matt Bell; Executive Director Regional Chamber of Northeast Indiana and Former State Representative</li> <li>Randy Borror; Former State Representative</li> <li>Dan Dumezich; Former State Representative</li> <li>Frankfort Mayor-elect Chris McBarnes </li> <li>Deborah Adams; Rush County Auditor </li> <li>Hal Slager; Schererville Town Councilman</li> <li>Jim Kittle; Former Indiana Republican Party Chairman</li> <li>John Hammond; Chairman of the 7th District</li> <li>Craig Dunn; Kokomo County Republican Chairman</li> <li>Bill Treadway; Vigo County Republican Chairman</li> <li>Tom John; Former Marion County Republican Chairman </li> <li>Mary Moses Cochran; Former Aide to Vice President Dan Quayle</li> </ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
