   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"When President Obama told hard-working Americans they didn't build their businesses, it wasn't just a poor choice of words – the President admitted he doesn't respect our nation's job creators. For nearly four years, President Obama has supported policies that will burden small businesses and kill jobs. And a second Obama term won't be any different, with tax hikes that will jeopardize 710,000 jobs. Mitt Romney has a different plan, which will empower small businesses and help create 12 million new jobs." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago, Candidate Obama Promised To Create An Environment Where Entrepreneurs "Can Take A Risk And Start A New Business":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, At The 2008 Democratic Convention: "We Measure The Strength Of Our Economy ...

If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet."
