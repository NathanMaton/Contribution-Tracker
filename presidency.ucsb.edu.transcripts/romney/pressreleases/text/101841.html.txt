   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama has talked about fixing Medicare for years. But when he's had the chance to act, the President ducked the hard decisions and cut $716 billion to pay for Obamacare. As president, Mitt Romney will put seniors first by strengthening Medicare and restoring President Obama's cuts that are driving up costs and jeopardizing benefits." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>One Year Ago Today, President Obama Warned That Failing To Fix Medicare Would "Gobble Up Basically The Entire Federal Budget":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama, One Year Ago Today: "The Bigger Problem Is Medicare And Medicaid. ... Medicare And Medicaid Would Gobble Up Basically The Entire Federal Budget." </b>OBAMA: "The bigger problem is Medicare and Medicaid. And the reason that's a problem is because health care costs keep on going up faster than inflation, people's wages, people's incomes at the same time as folks are getting older, so we've got more people into the system. And if we didn't do anything, then Medicare and Medicaid would gobble up basically the entire federal budget."

Unlike Social Security, the two main government-funded health-care programs &mdash; Medicare and Medicaid &mdash; really are broken; without any changes, by 2050 these two entitlements, along with Social Security, could grow to consume as large a share of our national economy as the entire federal budget does today. The addition of a hugely expensive prescription drug benefit that provides limited coverage and does nothing to control the cost of drugs has only made the problem worse. And the private system has evolved into a patchwork of inefficient bureaucracies, endless paperwork, overburdened providers, and dissatisfied patients."

Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis." OBAMA: "Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly. We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president." (Sen.
