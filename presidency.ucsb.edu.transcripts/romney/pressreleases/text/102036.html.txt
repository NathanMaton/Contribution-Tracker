Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will deliver a new direction that jumpstarts our economy and helps the middle-class families who have been left behind under President Obama." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>After Nearly Four Years, Millions Of Americans Are Struggling For Work And Facing Declining Incomes In The Obama Economy:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Under President Obama, More Than 23 Million Americans Are Struggling For Work And Unemployment Has Remained Above 8% For 42 Straight Months. </b>(<a href="http://bls.gov/">Bureau Of Labor Statistics</a>, Accessed 8/25/12) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Sentier Research: "Almost Every Group Is Worse Off Than It Was Three Years Ago, And Some Groups Had Very Large Declines In Income." </b>"'Almost every group is worse off than it was three years ago, and some groups had very large declines in income,' Green, who previously directed work on the Census Bureau's income and poverty statistics program, said in a phone interview today.
