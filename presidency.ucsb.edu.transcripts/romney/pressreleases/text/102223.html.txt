Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will strengthen the middle class by passing pro-growth policies that create 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for families." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago, Candidate Obama Told Charlotte Voters He Didn't "Want To Wake Up In Four Years" To Find More Middle-Class Families Struggling:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In Charlotte In 2008: "I Don't Want To Wake Up In Four Years To Find That More Americans Fell Out Of The Middle-Class, And More Families Lost Their Savings." </b>OBAMA: "I don't want to wake up in four years to find that more Americans fell out of the middle-class, and more families lost their savings.
