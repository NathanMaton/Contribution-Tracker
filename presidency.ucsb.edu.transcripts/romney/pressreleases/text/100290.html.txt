Senator Santorum can't seem to get his facts straight on his own record, either.

Public disclosure was left up to the individual members, many of whom took credit for projects in their districts or states. That lack of transparency changed in 2007, when the House and Senate passed legislation requiring the disclosure of earmarks.
