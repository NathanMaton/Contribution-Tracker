His opposition to developing domestic energy resources imperils our economic future and our national security. While President Obama is content with endless 'studying' and delay, Mitt Romney has a plan that will put Americans to back work, pump billions of dollars into the economy, and strengthen our energy security for decades to come." -Lanhee Chen, Romney for President Policy Director<h4><b>President Obama Has Blocked Offshore Domestic Energy Exploration In Virginia Until At Least 2018 - Despite Broad Bipartisan Support For Such Efforts:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Has Established A De-Facto Seven-Year Moratorium On Drilling Off The Virginia Coast.</b>&nbsp;"The Interior Department announcement set in motion a five-year environmental and seismic study of offshore areas, including off the Virginia coast, but no actual lease sales and drilling.
