Phil Gramm <p><b>Reagan and Obama: A Tale of Two Recoveries</b><br />Wall Street Journal<br />By Phil Gramm<br />August 29, 2012<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444812704577609863412900388.html"><br />http://online.wsj.com</a> <p>Only twice since World War II has the U.S. unemployment rate reached 10%: It was 10.8% in 1982 and 10% in 2009. The different responses of Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama&mdash;Reagan lowering taxes and lifting regulatory and other barriers to economic growth, Mr. Obama increasing the size and reach of the government&mdash;represent polar extremes in policy. And in results. <p>Fifty-five months after the recession started in July 1981, the Reagan recovery had created 7.8 million more jobs than when the recession started, and real per capita gross domestic product was up by $3,091. Fifty-five months after the recession that began in December 2007, there were four million fewer Americans working than when the recession started, and real per capita GDP was down $803. <p>The trajectory of household income is even more telling. According to Sentier Research analysis of monthly U.S. Census data, during the current recovery American households have lost more income than they lost during the recession. In December 2007, real median household income was $54,916. It had fallen to $53,508 when the recession ended 18 months later. But by June 2012, real median family income had fallen to $50,964. <p>During the Reagan recovery from 1981 to 1986, real median household income on an annualized basis rose by $3,380 or 7.7%. <p>... <p>In summary, the Obama administration not only has failed to bring back the American economy, it has ushered in a frightening growth in dependence. A review of the data from the 126 programs that today make up America's $1 trillion welfare system shows the same basic pattern over and over again. Expenditures on means-tested welfare programs have grown 2.5 times faster during the Obama administration than in any similar time period in American history. In those welfare programs that existed during the Reagan era, the recovery resulted in either a decline in beneficiaries or a slower rate of growth. These same programs have ballooned during this administration. <p>When Americans voted for Barack Obama in 2008, they knew or should have known that they were choosing a bigger federal government, higher taxes and an expansion in the role that government would play in their lives and businesses. They voted for it and they got it. <p>But Americans were not voting for economic stagnation, an explosion of entitlements and a doubling of the national debt. <p>... <p>As the European experience demonstrates, the cost of big government is not just higher taxes; it's lower growth, greater dependency and fiscal crisis. <p align="center"><i>**In compliance with copyright laws, this version of the editorial is excerpted**</i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
