We hope that he has the opportunity to enjoy some of our city's unique attractions. Many happen to be small businesses built by hardworking, independent folks, who are offended by the idea that their success is not the result of their own efforts. The President's assertion that 'you didn't build that' is at once mystifying and disappointing to those who've toiled mightily to build their businesses.&nbsp; In Louisiana, we've seen directly how President Obama's policies, founded on a deep misunderstanding of who creates prosperity, have failed to address our nation's economic problems."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
