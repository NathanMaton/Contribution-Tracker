Thousands of hospitals around the country will be punished and millions of retirees could lose their Medicare Advantage plans. As president, Mitt Romney will reverse these disastrous cuts, while ensuring Medicare is preserved and strengthened for future generations." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>President Obama Cut $716 Billion From Medicare To Pay For Obamacare –&nbsp; A Cut The Obama Campaign Now Refers To As An Achievement:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>According To The Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Obamacare Cuts $716 Billion From Medicare. </b>(Congressional Budget Office, <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43471-hr6079.pdf" target="_blank">Letter To Speaker John Boehner</a>, 7/24/12) <ul style="margin-left: 80px;"> <li><b><i>Miami Herald</i></b><b>: "Obama's $700 Billion Medicare-Cut Problem"</b> (Marc Caputo, "Obama's $700 Billion Medicare-Cut Problem," <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2012/08/obamas-700-billion-medicare-cut-problem.html" target="_blank"><i>Miami Herald</i></a>, 8/12/12)</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama's Senior Campaign Aide Has Bragged That President Obama "Achieved" $700 Billion In "Cuts In Medicare." </b>CUTTER: "Well, you know ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more.

Starting in October, Medicare will reduce reimbursements to hospitals with high 30-day readmission rates -- which refers to patients who return within a month -- by as much as 1 percent. The maximum penalty increases to 2 percent the following year and 3 percent in 2014."

Together, these hospitals will forfeit about $280 million in Medicare funds over the next year as the government begins a wide-ranging push to start paying health care providers based on the quality of care they provide."

The analysis of the penalties shows that 76 percent of the hospitals that have a lot of low-income patients will lose Medicare funds in the fiscal year starting in October. Only 55 percent of the hospitals treating few poor patients are going to be penalized, the analysis shows."

This estimated percentage would continue to increase, reaching roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent by 2050. In practice, providers could not sustain continuing negative margins and, absent legislative changes, would have to withdraw from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, merge with other provider groups, or shift substantial portions of Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers."&nbsp;("Projected Expenditures Under An Illustrative Scenario With Alternative Payment Updates To Medicare Providers," Center For Medicare & Medicaid Services, 5/13/11) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>52 Percent Of Doctors Say Obamacare Will Compel Them To Close Or Significantly Restrict Their Practices To Medicare Patients.</b> (Merritt Hawkins, "Health Reform and the Decline of Physician Private Practice," The Physicians Foundation, October 2010) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Obamacare's Cuts Will Cause Enrollment In Medicare Advantage To "Plummet By About 50 Percent" And Leave Seniors With "Higher Out-Of-Pocket Costs."</b> "In addition to flagging provider cuts as potentially unsustainable, the report [HHS] projected that reductions in payments to private Medicare Advantage plans would trigger an exodus from the popular alternative. Enrollment would plummet by about 50 percent. Seniors leaving the private plans would still have health insurance under traditional Medicare, but many might face higher out-of-pocket costs."
