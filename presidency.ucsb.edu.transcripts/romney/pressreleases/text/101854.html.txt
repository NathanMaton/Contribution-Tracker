But after nearly four years in office, the only thing President Obama has accomplished is a massive $716 billion cut from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. As president, Mitt Romney will reverse President Obama's cuts and strengthen Medicare for our nation's seniors and future retirees." &mdash; Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4></h4><h4><b>Since His Election To The Senate, Barack Obama Has Repeatedly Claimed Medicare Is "Broken" And He's Pledged To Fix It:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Senator Obama, In <i>The Audacity Of Hope</i>: "The Two Main Government-Funded Health-Care Programs &mdash; Medicare And Medicaid &mdash; Really Are Broken..."</b> "As vital as it may be to raise the wages of American workers and improve their retirement security, perhaps our most pressing task is to fix our broken health-care system. Unlike Social Security, the two main government-funded health-care programs &mdash; Medicare and Medicaid &mdash; really are broken; without any changes, by 2050 these two entitlements, along with Social Security, could grow to consume as large a share of our national economy as the entire federal budget does today. The addition of a hugely expensive prescription drug benefit that provides limited coverage and does nothing to control the cost of drugs has only made the problem worse. And the private system has evolved into a patchwork of inefficient bureaucracies, endless paperwork, overburdened providers, and dissatisfied patients."

Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis." OBAMA: "Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly. We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president." (Sen.

We're Now At The End Of The Road, And We're Not In A Position To Kick Any Further." </b>OBAMA: "The real problem with our long-term deficit actually has to do with our entitlement obligations and the fact that, historically, if our revenues ranged from between 18 and 20 percent of GDP, they're now at 16, it's just not sustainable. So, we're going to have to craft a—what George Stephanopoulos called a 'grand bargain,' and I try not to use the word grand in anything that I say, but we're going to have to shape a bargain. This, by the way, is where there are going to be some very difficult choices and issues of sacrifice and responsibility and duty are going to come in, because what we have done is kick this can down the road. We're now at the end of the road, and we're not in a position to kick it any further."
