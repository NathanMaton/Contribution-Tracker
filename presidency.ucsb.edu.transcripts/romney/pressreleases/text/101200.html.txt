I've actually met Governor Romney, the first time back in 2008, and I've been impressed with his focus and his results--his results as Governor and his results in business. As a matter of fact, I followed Governor Romney very closely in Massachusetts. My wife was born and raised in Massachusetts and I've spent a lot of time up there visiting family. And I think what he did as Governor was quite extraordinary. And it's something that I think we could really use as our Chief Executive in the White House. Everything from dealing with the bubble bursting in technology and the job losses in the early 2000s and the way that he was able to get the state back on track both in terms of job creation driving down the unemployment rate and actually driving up Massachusetts's profile for job creation as well as credit worthiness. I think they're all the kinds of things the trending that we've seen over the last four years at the national level is the exact opposite of the kinds of results Governor Romney accomplished when he was in Massachusetts. And I fully expect that he'll do the same thing for us when he's elected President in November."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
