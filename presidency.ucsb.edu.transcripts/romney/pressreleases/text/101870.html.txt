America's support of Israel should make every American proud. We should not allow the inevitable complexities of modern geopolitics to obscure fundamental touchstones. No country or organization or individual should ever doubt this basic truth:&nbsp; A free and strong America will always stand with a free and strong Israel. And standing by Israel does not mean with military and intelligence cooperation alone.&nbsp; We cannot stand silent as those who seek to undermine Israel, voice their criticisms.&nbsp; And we certainly should not join in that criticism. Diplomatic distance in our public between our nations emboldens Israel's adversaries. By history and by conviction, our two countries are bound together.&nbsp; No individual, no nation, no world organization, will pry us apart. And as long as we stay together and stand together, there is no threat we cannot overcome and very little that we cannot achieve."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
