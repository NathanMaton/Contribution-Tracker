How do we stop it?" AXELROD: "Joe, there's an investigation going &mdash; well, you stop it by sending strong signals. Strong signals have been sent. There are leaks out of every administration." (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 7/25/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>When Asked Pointedly If He Could Say "Nobody From The White House Was Involved," White House Spokesman Jay Carney Replied: "In Which Particular Case?"</b> HENRY: "One of your past statements from June 11 when you said it's absurd when Senator McCain suggested people inside the White House leaked this information for political gain. In June, David Axelrod flatly said on ABC that nobody in the White House was involved and David Axelrod was on MSNBC yesterday and said the President did not leak anything and then followed up by saying the President did not authorize any leaks. That's different. That leaves up the door that there were unauthorized leaks by White House people. So, have you moved the goal posts?" CARNEY: "No, Ed, I think you're conflating a lot of things. All of those statements are completely true. I stand by what I've said and Mr. Axelrod and the President has said..." HENRY: "He said no one from the White House was involved. Can you today say that nobody from the White House was involved?" CARNEY: "Involved in which particular case are you talking about? I can tell you that the President takes this very seriously."

It's Wrong."</b> OBAMA: "The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive.&nbsp; It's wrong.&nbsp; And people I think need to have a better sense of how I approach this office and how the people around me here approach this office."

I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from its ranks. I don't know specifically where, but I think they have to begin to understand that and do something about it. I mean, there's one book they can read and they'll see it very clearly."

Dianne Feinstein said Tuesday that she shouldn't have speculated about leaks coming from the White House, walking back hear earlier comments that the White House was partly responsible for the leak of national security information. The California Democrat, who chairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she regretted speculating about the White House's role in leaks relating to national security. 'I was asked [at the World Affairs Council on Monday] whether the White House might be responsible for recent national security leaks. I stated that I did not believe the president leaked classified information. I shouldn't have speculated beyond that, because the fact of the matter is I don't know the source of the leaks,' Feinstein said in her statement."

Some congressional Democrats insisted on the need for a special counsel yesterday. In a letter to Ashcroft, Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (S.D.) and Sens. Joseph R.&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;Jr. (Del.), Carl M. Levin (Mich.) and John D. Rockefeller IV (W.Va.) requested a special counsel 'because of the obvious and inherent conflicts of interests involved.'"

Joe Biden issued the following statement: 'Yesterday's action by the Department of Justice calling on the House Intelligence Committee to delay its investigation highlights the need for a Special Counsel to immediately take over the investigation into the destruction of taped interrogations by the CIA. The American people deserve a thorough, unbiased investigation, free of any political influence. The investigation should be conducted by someone who had no involvement in the conduct under investigation." (Sen.

Why did they destroy the tapes? You know, I just think this is getting very convoluted. And I think the easiest, straightest thing to do, is take it out of the political realm, appoint a special prosecutor and let them decide and call it where it is. Is there a criminal violation? If there is, proceed. If not, don't." (ABC's "This Week," 12/9/07)</li></ul></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
