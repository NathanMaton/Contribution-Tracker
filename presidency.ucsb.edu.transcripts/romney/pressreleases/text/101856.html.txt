   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"One year ago, the President's failure to rein in reckless government spending led to a downgrade in the creditworthiness of our nation.&nbsp; President Obama's spending binge now has him on pace to add more than $1 trillion to the debt for the fourth straight year.&nbsp; And it's the middle class that will pay most dearly for this out-of-control spending. The contrast between President Obama and me on this critical issue could not be more clear.&nbsp; As Governor, I led Massachusetts to a credit upgrade. And as president, my Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will not only deliver more jobs and more take-home pay for American families, but it will also reduce spending to responsible levels.&nbsp; I will lead us toward a balanced budget and restore the sterling credit rating our nation lost under President Obama." &mdash; Mitt Romney<h4><b>One Year Ago Today, America's Triple-A Credit Rating Was Cut For The First Time In History:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>One Year Ago Today, "S&amp;P Removed For The First Time The Triple-A Rating The U.S. Has Held For 70 Years." </b>"S&amp;P removed for the first time the triple-A rating the U.S. has held for 70 years, saying the budget deal recently brokered in Washington didn't do enough to address the gloomy outlook for America's finances.
