Senator Santorum, on the other hand, apparently never met an earmark he didn't like. The Washington politicians who got us into this mess can't possibly lead us out. Mitt Romney spent his career building businesses and leading large enterprises through troubled times. As president, he will cut spending, reform government, and get our economy back on track." &mdash;Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director<h4><b>Santorum Voted To Add Trillions To The National Debt As Spending Soared During His Time In Washington:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>"Santorum Acknowledged Voting To Raise The Federal Debt Ceiling At Least Five Times While In Congress."</b> (Charles Babington, "Gingrich Defends His Attacks," <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/NEWS/2012-01-15-PNI0115wir-GOP-forum_ST_U.htm"><i>The Associated Press</i></a>, 1/15/12)<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Federal Spending Increased By Roughly 80% During Santorum's Tenure In The Senate.</b> In 1995, Santorum's first year in the Senate, federal spending was approximately $1.516 trillion. By 2007, when Santorum left the Senate, spending had increased to approximately $2.729 trillion.

I'll Defend Earmarks."</b> SANTORUM: "I'm not saying necessarily earmarks are bad. I have had a lot of earmarks. In fact, I'm very proud of all the earmarks I put in bills. I'll defend earmarks."

I'll Tell You Why. I Had To Spend The Surpluses."</b> "Confronted with projected deficits until fiscal 2007, senior GOP lawmakers are backing away from long-standing rhetoric about the government's duty to live within its means. 'I came to the House as a real deficit hawk, but I am no longer a deficit hawk,' said Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). 'I'll tell you why. I had to spend the surpluses. Deficits make it easier to say no.'"

And those issues are not Santorum's strong suit. ... He never met an earmark that he didn't like. In fact, it wasn't just earmarks for his own state that he favored, which might be forgiven as pure electoral pragmatism, but earmarks for everyone..."

Indeed, he was trounced in 2006 by 18 points by Bob Casey Jr., the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent since 1980."

By the time of his nearly 18-point loss &mdash; a stunning margin for a two-term incumbent &mdash; he had also alienated women voters, moderate Republicans and independents &mdash; not to mention the Democrats he had once won over. He lost almost every region of the state and almost every demographic group, including the blue collar workers he singles out on the campaign trail in 2012."
