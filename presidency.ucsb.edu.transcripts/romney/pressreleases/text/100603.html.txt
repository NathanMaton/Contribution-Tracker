   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Four years ago, Candidate Obama promised energy policies that were bound to hurt Pennsylvania families. Unfortunately, that's one of the few promises he kept. President Obama appointed advocates for higher energy prices to key administration posts while wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on crony capitalist boondoggles. We need a president who understands that it's not acceptable to block domestic energy production and regulate companies out of business while sticking taxpayers and consumers with the bill." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>While Running For President, Candidate Obama Bragged That His Policies Would "Bankrupt" Those Seeking To Build New Coal Plants:</b></h4><p><b>In 2008, Senator Obama Claimed His Administration's Policies Would "Bankrupt" Anyone Who Tried To Build A Coal Plant.</b> OBAMA: "So, if somebody wants to build a coal plant, they can &mdash; it's just that it will bankrupt them, because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted."

The standard will generally require that new power plants emit CO2 at a rate no greater than that of a natural-gas-fired power plant. Such plants emit about 60 percent less greenhouse gases than coal plants."

That, in turn, will raise electricity costs for consumers, said American Electric Power spokesman Pat Hemlepp." (Juliet Eilperin and Darryl Fears, "EPA To Impose New Power Plant Rules," <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/epa-to-impose-new-power-plant-rules/2011/07/07/gIQACem11H_story.html"><i>The Washington Post</i></a>, 7/7/11)<p><b>In Pennsylvania, Many Plants "Are Facing Hard Decisions" About How To Comply With EPA Regulations. </b>"As for Pennsylvania's plants, most upgrades have been made at the newer and larger ones. So about 65 percent of the state's coal-fired generating capacity already has controls that would meet the new regulations, said Douglas Biden, president of the Electric Power Generation Association, a Pennsylvania industry group. But many older plants are facing hard decisions. Much like a family with a clunker car, they have to determine at what point it is no longer worth making more repairs."

The Houston-based power company announced the power plant deactivations Wednesday as part of its 2011 earnings report, blaming economics and federal environmental regulations requiring installation of pollution control equipment. ... Mr. Davies said the three Western Pennsylvania plant closures will result in a loss of 180 jobs &mdash; 60 at Elrama, 40 at New Castle and 80 at Shawville."
