During this campaign, he has resorted to telling frequent and absurd falsehoods about Governor Romney's record. Senator Santorum can't seem to get his facts straight. If Americans can't trust him to tell the truth on the campaign trail, how would they trust him as president?" &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Senator Santorum Has Previously Called Himself "Often Wrong, But Never In Doubt":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Santorum, Admitting What Others Know: "Often Wrong, But Never In Doubt." </b>"'Often wrong,' [Santorum] called himself in one column.

He Has Never Advocated Or Supported A Federal Mandate."</b> "Romney has been consistent in saying that he would apply a state-based approach to health care. He has said the individual mandate worked well for Massachusetts, he may have even predicted that most other states would eventually adopt it, but he has never advocated or supported a federal mandate &mdash; as contained in the president's law. This alone would earn the DNC at least three Pinocchios, but we were also disturbed by the manipulative editing in this ad. There is no excuse for the DNC to simply ignore, in the same 2008 debate, Romney's firm reaffirmation that he preferred a federalist approach."
