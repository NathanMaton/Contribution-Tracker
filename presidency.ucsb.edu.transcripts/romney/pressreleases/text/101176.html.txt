If it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing, we're going to have to have a president, and I'm that one, that's going to get rid of Obamacare and we're going to stop it on day one. What we're witnessing is a failure of the President's policies. He did not deal with immigration. With regards to Obamacare, he put that as a higher priority than our economy and as a result we have had forty straight months with unemployment above eight percent.
