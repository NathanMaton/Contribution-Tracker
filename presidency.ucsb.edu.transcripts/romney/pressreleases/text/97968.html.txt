Certainly, someone who passionately believes in our conservative values. <p>But considering what's at stake — the possibility of four more years of President Barack Obama's ruinously wrongheaded ideas — electability is a key factor. We have to win. <p>This is a topic I know something about. It's one reason I endorsed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president. <p>I served two terms as a Republican governor of a blue state. The last time Minnesota voted for a Republican candidate for president was 1972. It has the dubious distinction of the nation's longest streak of voting for the Democratic presidential candidate. <p>But Republicans can be elected statewide in Minnesota. I was. The reason is fairly straightforward. <p>Practical, common-sense conservative ideas to increase jobs and reduce government burdens improve people's lives. Voters, whether Republican, Democrat or independent, understand this. As governor, I found innovative ways to balance Minnesota's budget, cut spending, reform health care and bolster education — all without raising taxes. <p>I also did my best to lead with a hopeful and positive message and leadership style. <p>Mitt has done the same. A conservative businessman, he won the support of independent voters — and even some Democrats — to win election as governor of the blue state of Massachusetts. That is no small accomplishment. <p>It reveals Romney's tremendous strength in bringing Americans together. <p>He also governed successfully. His state's economy was mired in recession when he took office. Expenditures exceeded revenue. Without raising taxes — he cut taxes on 19 occasions — he balanced the budget and led the effort to turn the state's economy around. <p>By the time he left office, Massachusetts had a $2 billion budget surplus — and was again gaining jobs. <p>While all the Republican candidates have their respective strengths, Romney is uniquely positioned to help the Republican Party return to the White House. <p>Though he had an outstanding tenure as governor, Romney's not a career politician. He's spent most of his adult life working in the private sector — launching new businesses and rescuing failing ones. <p>He has an extraordinary command of the economic challenges we face, gained from day-in, day-out experience working in the marketplace. If ever America needed a leader who knows his way around the business world, it is now. Unemployment is more than 9 percent, and the economy is poised for a second recession. <p>We should not underestimate the challenge Republicans face in the coming general election. Obama's poll numbers may be low, but he possesses the enormous advantage of incumbency. <p>He can use the presidency's powerful bully pulpit to promote his message. He is viewed by many as friendly and likable — even if they consider his policies as off the mark. He's a skilled and fiercely determined campaigner. <p>Obama also has the support of Big Labor. It has a proven ability to get its rank-and-file members to the polls and raise large sums of campaign cash. <p>The president most likely will raise and spend nearly $1 billion on his reelection effort. <p>We should not give Obama a major additional advantage by nominating a vulnerable candidate. That would be a historic missed opportunity for the conservative movement — and the cause to restore America. <p>Social Security, for example, provides a vital safety net for millions of Americans. While Romney has long seen that Social Security has severe, long-term financial problems, he favors saving and protecting the program by fixing those problems. <p>He has not denounced the program — as some have done — and called it unconstitutional. He has not proposed that Social Security be turned over to state governments. Those are untenable positions and would cost Republicans dearly in the election. <p>Romney would be an outstanding president. He's smart, principled, conservative and experienced. But for conservatives to lead America to a brighter future — it's mission critical that our candidate win the election. <p>Romney can. And when he does — America's future will be immeasurably better as a result.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
