We're willing to talk about specific proposals to reform entitlements and at grave political challenge or risk. And actually the country is saying we respect the fact that &nbsp;you're willing to be bold and specific, but where's the President? You can hardly find him even touching much less specifically addressing some of the most pressing financial issues of the country right now: our debt, our deficit, the entitlement's role in that. Where is he? Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney have actually said we'll put a marker down, we'll stand behind it, and we'll debate it. Come on, Mr. President, where are you? You know where he is? You can't find him." <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>ANDREA MITCHELL:</b> "Well, he's out campaigning. That's for sure." <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>TIM PAWLENTY:</b> "He's talking about beer and other stuff. You can't find his entitlement proposal to speak of.
