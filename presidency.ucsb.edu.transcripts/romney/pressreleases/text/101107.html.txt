   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Today's weak jobs report is devastating news for American workers and American families. This week has seen a cascade of one bad piece of economic news after another. Slowing GDP growth, plunging consumer confidence, an increase in unemployment claims, and now another dismal jobs report all stand as a harsh indictment of the President's handling of the economy. It is now clear to everyone that President Obama's policies have failed to achieve their goals and that the Obama economy is crushing America's middle class. The President's re-election slogan may be 'forward,' but it seems like we've been moving backward. We can do so much better in America. That's why I'm running for president." –Mitt Romney<h4><b>The Nation's Job Climate "Dimmed" Last Month After Another "Bleak" Unemployment Report:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Last Month, "The Nation's Jobs Picture Dimmed" With Unemployment Increasing To 8.2%. </b>"The nation's jobs picture dimmed in May as employers added just 69,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2 percent, a continuation of a long, slow employment recovery that began 33 months ago."
