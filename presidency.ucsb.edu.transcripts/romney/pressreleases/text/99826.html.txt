Virginians are looking for a results-oriented conservative like Mitt Romney to reverse the failed policies that have hindered our nation's economic recovery. Mitt has a strong track record of conservative leadership both in business and as Governor of Massachusetts. We need a president who has actually spent time in the private sector and knows what it takes to create jobs. That's why I'm proud to stand with him and urge my fellow Virginians to do the same."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
