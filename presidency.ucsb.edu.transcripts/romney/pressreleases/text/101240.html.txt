With unemployment stuck over 8 percent for 40 months, we can't afford policies that kill jobs and stifle innovation in one of America's most dynamic industries. The ill-considered medical device tax is only one of many fatal flaws in Obamacare. As president, I will work from my first day in office to dismantle Barack Obama's federal health-care takeover and replace it with real reform that strengthens our health care system and puts patients first." –Mitt Romney<h4><b>Today, The House Of Representatives Repealed The Medical Device Tax – An Obamacare Policy That Harms American Job Creators:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>This Afternoon, The House Of Representatives Voted To Repeal The 2.3% Tax In Obamacare That Will Be Imposed On Medical Device Makers. </b>"Shrugging off a veto threat, Republicans are ready to push legislation through the House repealing a tax on the producers of many medical devices sold in the United States. GOP leaders scheduled a vote for Thursday, and with more than half the House sponsoring the measure its passage was ensured.
