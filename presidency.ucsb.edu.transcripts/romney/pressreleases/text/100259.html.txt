You don't share that reaction if [Rick] Santorum were the nominee, do you?"<p><b>MITT ROMNEY: </b>"No, of course not. We need to have a Republican president. Just think about the selections of the Supreme Court Justices that a conservative would put in place. Think about the energy policies that I and other conservatives would put in place. Think about repealing Obamacare which I would do and other Republicans would do. Think about lowering taxes and getting our economy growing to create jobs again that I and other Republicans would carry out. We have a very different agenda than President Obama. And I'm just afraid that Rick has become so wrapped up in his campaign that he thinks it is about a person. This campaign, this election, is not about one person. It is about the direction for our country. And the direction we are headed in right now is dangerous and is making America a weaker nation economically and also militarily. And it's time for us to take a very different course. I will support our Republican nominee and believe he is heads-and-shoulders above President Obama."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
