   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"During his time in office, President Obama has repeatedly shown how out of touch he is with the realities of our economy. Two years ago today, he kicked off a 'Recovery Summer' campaign that never arrived. Now, he claims the private sector is 'doing fine.' Time and again, President Obama has shown an extraordinary misunderstanding of how our economy works.
