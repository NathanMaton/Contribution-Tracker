   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"It was just eight years ago Barack Obama's keynote address promised 'a politics of hope' and a rejection of those 'who are preparing to divide us.' But that Barack Obama is nowhere to be found now that Americans aren't better off, with stagnant unemployment, lower incomes, and a poverty rate on track to hit its highest rate since the 1960s. Americans deserve better from their president than divisive politics and misleading attacks." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Tonight's Keynote Address At The Democratic Convention Will Invoke President Obama's "Soaring, Post-Partisan Rhetoric" From His 2004 Keynote Address:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>The Democratic Convention's Keynote Address Will Serve As "National Introduction" For Mayor Julian Castro – "Much Like It Was For Obama In 2004." </b>"The speech, which will be given the opening night of the convention in Charlotte, will serve as a national introduction for Castro &mdash; much like it was for Obama in 2004. The then-Illinois senator delivered an iconic speech about his own backstory and called for national unity during the Boston convention that nominated John Kerry for President. Political observers have credited that address, which received rapturous reviews, for playing a major role in propelling Obama into the presidential mix in 2008."

'I remember watching his speech in 2004 and being inspired,' Castro said in a video released by convention organizers. 'When Obama talked about the audacity of hope, I thought back to my mother saying if you didn't like the way things were, you could dare to change them,' he said."

Do we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it, or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it."

Specifically, that was so soooo Barack Obama in 2004, when the little-known state Senator from Illinois made these inspiring comments at the Democratic National Convention. Four years after that, Obama waged his juggernaut of a hope-and-change campaign. Now he heads up a seek-and-destroy effort. That means TV viewers in battleground states like Florida will face a lot more negative messaging from both sides than in 2008."
