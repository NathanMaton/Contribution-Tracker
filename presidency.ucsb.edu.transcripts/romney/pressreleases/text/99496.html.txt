"This wide-ranging support shows that my message of a smaller, simpler, and smarter federal government is resonating with Minnesotans as it is with voters across the country. I'm counting on these leaders to help me spread this message in the months to come."<p>Announcing his support, Speaker Kurt Zellers said, "Minnesotans simply cannot take four more years of President Obama's disastrous policies. Mitt Romney is the conservative candidate who has a clear plan to empower small businesses, rebuild the middle class, and create long-lasting economic growth. I am endorsing Mitt because he will work to improve the economy, reduce burdensome regulations and reverse economic policies that expand government rather than private sector job growth."<p><b>Minnesota Elected Officials and Leaders Supporting Mitt Romney:</b><p>Speaker of the House Kurt Zellers<p>House Majority Leader Matt Dean<p>Senator Roger Chamberlain <p>Representative Kurt Daudt<p>Representative Dan Fabian <p>Representative Joe Hoppe<p>Representative Jennifer Loon<p>Representative Linda Runbeck<p>Representative Tim Sanders<p>Former Executive Director, Minnesota College Republicans Tara Anderson<p>Former Mayor of New Brighton and former 4th district GOP Chair Bev Aplikowski<p>Former National Committeewoman Evie Axdahl<p>Republican Activist Dirk Bak<p>Former Republican Candidate for Minnesota Attorney General Chris Barden<p>Republican Activist Andy Brehm<p>Republican Activist Ward Brehm<p>Former State Representative Laura Brod<p>Republican Activist Mike Campbell <p>Former Chairman, Republican Party of Minnesota Ron Eibensteiner<p>Republican Activist John Frydenlund<p>Republican Activist Matthew Gall<p>Republican Activist Betsy Gall<p>Former Chairman, Minnesota College Republicans Jake Grassel<p>Minnesota Republican Party 4th Congressional District Officer Mary Igo<p>Former Minnesota Republican Party 4th Congressional District Chair Pat Igo<p>Small Business Owner Gary Iocco<p>Former Minnesota Republican Party Vice-Chairwoman Chris Jacobson<p>Republican Activist Greg Johnson<p>Minnesota Republican Party BPOU Chair Pat Kaluza<p>Republican Activist Matt Kirkpatrick<p>Republican Activist Carrie Kirkpatrick<p>Former State Representative Paul Kohls<p>Republican Activist Lisa Laliberte Belak<p>Vice President of Trade Marketing, General Mills Lohr LeSueur<p>Minnesota Republican Party 8th Congressional District Chair Ted Lovdahl<p>Mayor of Brooklyn Park Jeff Lunde<p>Republican Activist Lynn McHale<p>Former National Committeeman &amp; Chairman of Romney for President Steering Committee Jack Meeks<p>Former Executive Director, Minnesota Republican Party Corey Miltimore<p>Republican Activist William Opsahl<p>Republican Activist Andy Post<p>Republican Activist Jeff Quinnell<p>Chairman of the BPOU Chairs Joe Salmon<p>Former Treasurer, College Republican National Committee and 7th Congressional District Vice Chair Chris Tiedeman<p>Former Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Bob Weinholzer<p>Former BPOU Chair Janet Weir<p>Former BPOU Chair Gerald Woodley<p></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
