   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"President Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending. We've been down that road before &mdash; and it's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent. It's clear that the only plan President Obama has is more of the same. Mitt Romney believes that lower tax rates and less government will jump-start the economy and create jobs." &mdash; Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Today, President Obama Will Discuss His Tax Plan During His Ohio Campaign Stop:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama Is Campaigning In Ohio On His Tax Hike Plan. </b>"Dueling with Republicans on taxes, President Barack Obama is urging the House to pass a tax cut for households earning less than $250,000 a year and drawing a bright line with rival Mitt Romney on a pocketbook issue for voters."
