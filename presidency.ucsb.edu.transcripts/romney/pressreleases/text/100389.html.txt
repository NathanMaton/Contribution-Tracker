"This is further proof that my pro-growth message is resonating with voters and that Californians want a conservative businessman to replace President Obama. I look forward to their counsel in my efforts to bring back jobs and restore fiscal sanity in Washington."<p>Announcing Mitt Romney's California Leadership Team, former Governor and Romney California Honorary Co-Chairman Pete Wilson said, "This election is too important for our party to nominate a candidate without the real-world economic experience and proven track record that Mitt Romney has demonstrated throughout this campaign and throughout his life. The members of his California Leadership Team have already been hard at work spreading his pro-growth message and working to ensure that President Obama is defeated in November. I am proud to be a part of this team and encourage my fellow Republicans to unite behind the one candidate we know can beat President Obama and create an economic climate that will bring jobs back to California."<h4><b>Mitt Romney's California Leadership Team:</b></h4><h4><b>Statewide Honorary Chairmen</b></h4><p>Governor Pete Wilson<br>Governor George Deukmejian<p>Statewide Chairs<p>Meg Whitman<br>House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy<br>Congressman Darrell Issa<br>Congresswoman Mary Bono-Mack<br>Congressman Buck McKeon<br>State Senator Tony Strickland<br>Carly Fiorina<h4><b>Statewide Co-Chairs</b></h4><p>Congressman Brian Bilbray<br>Congressman Ken Calvert<br>Congressman John Campbell<br>Congressman Jeff Denham<br>Congressman Wally Herger<br>Congressman Jerry Lewis<br>Congressman Dana Rohrabacher<br>State Senate Republican Leader Bob Huff<br>Assembly Republican Leader Connie Conway<br>State Senator Sam Blakeslee<br>State Senator Bob Dutton<br>State Senator Sharon Runner<br>State Senator Mark Wyland<br>Assemblyman Paul Cook<br>Assemblyman Jim Silva<br>Bill Simon<h4><b>Statewide Steering Committee</b></h4><p>State Senator Tom Berryhill<br>State Senator Anthony Cannella<br>State Senator Bill Emmerson<br>State Senator Jean Fuller<br>State Senator Ted Gaines<br>State Senator Tom Harman<br>State Senator Mimi Walters<br>Assemblyman Curt Hagman<br>Assemblyman Kevin Jeffries<br>Assemblyman Jim Nielsen<br>Assemblyman Don Wagner<br>LA District Attorney Steve Cooley<br>Former Senate Republican Leader Dick Ackerman</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
