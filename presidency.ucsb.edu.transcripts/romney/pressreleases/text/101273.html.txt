   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Our Time." Three years after President Obama proudly proclaimed that the economy was his, more than 23 million Americans are still out of work, underemployed, or no longer looking for work and we've seen forty straight months of unemployment over 8 percent. Just last week, the President said the economy "isn't where it needs to be." President Obama has had his moment and failed. Now it is our time.<p><i>To View "Our Time" Please See</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/P7oWPB">http://mi.tt/P7oWPB</a><h4><b>AD FACTS: Script For "Our Time" </b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "July 14, 2009"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "Three Years Ago"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "Barack Obama Told The Country That He Is Responsible For The Economy..."</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "July 14, 2009"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: </b>"So I welcome the job.
