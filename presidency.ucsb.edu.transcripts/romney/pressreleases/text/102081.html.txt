It's that failure to accomplish the very goals he set out for himself that is the greatest indictment of Obama's presidency." – Gov. Scott Walker <h4><b>Obama's Broken Promises</b></h4> <p>Politico<br />Gov. Scott Walker<br />August 31, 2012<a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=44E07092-8D95-479A-AD7C-4649DEE4B48E" target="_blank"><br />http://politico.com</a> <p>The reviews of Rep. Paul Ryan's acceptance speech for the Republican vice presidential nomination are in, and it's being cited as a success. Is there any wonder that the Obama campaign staffers and surrogates are in full-blown damage control mode, screaming that Paul was unfair in some of his criticisms of President Barack Obama? <p>You've likely all now heard about the General Motors plant in Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wis. It's closed – has been as long as Obama has been in president. Bailout be damned. Ryan told the story of that plant on Wednesday night. <p>"A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant," Ryan said. "Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you ... this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That's what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day." <p>When the Obama campaign heard that, they couldn't yell "Liar!" loud enough. But the question remains, what exactly did Ryan say that's not true? Did Obama say that? Yep &mdash; and there's video to prove it. Did the plant shut down within the year? It did. Is it locked up and empty to this day? As anyone from Janesville knows, it certainly is. <p>So why is the Obama campaign so upset? Like so many things in this election, they don't want to focus on how Obama's promises have turned out. They want to blame somebody else for our problems. They are telling us the plant closed before Obama could put his policies into place. So we shouldn't blame him for that. <p>But here's where the Obama campaign's argument goes off the rails &mdash; and here's why Ryan's speech scares them so much. <p>Ryan wasn't blaming Obama for closing that Wisconsin plant. As he said in his speech. "President Barack Obama came to office during an economic crisis, as he has reminded us a time or two." Ryan said, "Those were very tough days, and any fair measure of his record has to take that into account." <p>This election is not about what happened before Obama become president. It's about his failure to make things better, and it is about where we are going in the future. <p>Obama didn't close that factory &mdash; but he hasn't re-opened it either. Despite telling the people of Janesville that was the plan. When GM announced in October 2008 that it would be halting production there, then-candidate Obama said, "As president, I will lead an effort to retool plants like the GM facility in Janesville so we can build the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow and create good-paying jobs in Wisconsin and all across America." <p>Though Obama got his bailout, the people of Janesville are still waiting for that re-tooling. It's that failure to accomplish the very goals he set out for himself that is the greatest indictment of Obama's presidency. <p>The president has not brought prosperity back to Janesville. <p>"And that's how it is in so many towns today," Ryan said, "where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight." <p>That's a fact that no amount of spin or hysteria can change. And it's a fact that seems to terrify the Obama campaign to its very core.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
