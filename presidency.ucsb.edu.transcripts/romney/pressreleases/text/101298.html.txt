But his liberal policies of skyrocketing debt and deficits just haven't lived up to the promises he's made. As president, Mitt Romney will finally deliver the change Washington needs by reining in wasteful spending and getting our economy moving again." –Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>For The Last Four Years, President Obama Has Assured Iowa Voters He Would Rein In Wasteful Spending And Address The National Debt:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In Des Moines In 2008: "I Will Go Through The Federal Budget, Line-By-Line, Ending Programs That We Don't Need And Making The Ones We Do Need Work Better And Cost Less." </b>OBAMA: "As President, I will go through the federal budget, line-by-line, ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less.
