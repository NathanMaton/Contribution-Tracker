Gov. Romney has a solid track record of turning around troubled situations like the one we face in Washington.&nbsp; He did it in the private sector, as leader of the Salt Lake City Olympics, and as governor of Massachusetts.&nbsp; He has the kind of common-sense approach this country needs to turn the economy around and put people back to work.&nbsp; I encourage Tennesseans to join me in casting their vote for Gov. Mitt Romney in Tuesday's election."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
