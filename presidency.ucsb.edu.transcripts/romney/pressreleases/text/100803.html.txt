In 2008, President Obama promised to create millions of new jobs and invest in new energy sources. Today, the energy industry has lost thousands of jobs and Solyndra, to which the Obama Administration loaned over half a billion dollars, is out of business.<p><i>To View "Broken Promises: Energy" Please See</i>: <a href="http://mi.tt/JNsMKf">http://mi.tt/JNsMKf</a><h4><b>AD FACTS: Script For "Broken Promises: Energy"</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "August 28, 2008"</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>VIDEO TEXT: "What Barack Obama Promised..."</b><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>SEN.

The bankruptcy also represents a high-profile failure for a federal stimulus program that gives loan guarantees to green-tech manufacturers. Solyndra was the first company to win one of the guarantees, receiving $535 million in 2009 to build its second factory in Fremont less than a mile from the company's original plant." (David R.
