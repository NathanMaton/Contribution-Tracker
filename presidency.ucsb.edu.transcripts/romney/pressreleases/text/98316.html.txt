When Republicans took one of the most courageous votes I've seen in at least a decade to call for the reform of Medicare under the Paul Ryan plan, he goes public and says this is a ‘right-wing social engineering' plan. Recently he even called it ‘suicide.' I know it can be popular with some people to use extreme language, but we're talking about the presidency of the United States." &mdash;Mitt Romney</center><h4><b>ROUND ONE &mdash; "Right-Wing Social Engineering" And "Radical Change":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Gingrich, In May: "I Don't Think Right-Wing Social Engineering Is Any More Desirable Than Left-Wing Social Engineering."</b> GINGRICH: "I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate. I think we need a national conversation to get to a better Medicare system with more choices for seniors."

GINGRICH: "I think that that is too big a jump. I think what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options, not one where you suddenly impose upon the ... I'm against Obamacare, which is imposing radical change, and I would be against a conservative imposing radical change."

GINGRICH: "Look, it was a technical mistake, but what I said was true. I was asked the question should Republicans impose a plan if it is deeply unpopular. And I said something that was written about, right wing social engineering is as dangerous at left wing social engineering. I had a lot of my conservative friends mad at me, but in fact, Hayek wrote it because he was right." (Fox News' "Hannity," 11/30/11)<h4><b>ROUND THREE &mdash; Political "Suicide":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>Last Week, Gingrich Described The Ryan Plan As "Suicide."</b> GINGRICH: "What I was saying was in answer to a very specific question, which was: if there's a program which is very, very unpopular, should Republicans impose it? And my answer is no! When we passed welfare reform, 92% of the country favored it, including 88% of people on welfare. Reagan ran to be a popular president, not to maximize suicide. And I think conservatives have got to understand, you govern over the long run by having the American people think you're doing a good job, and think you're doing what they want."

Indeed, in a Friday interview with Ben Domenech, Gingrich conceded that his program is designed as a modest tweak to Medicare Advantage, and decried Ryan's plan as ‘suicidal.'"

I, for one, believe the country is ready, they're hungry for it. They are ready to hear real solutions. We shouldn't wait around for the status quo to become popular. Leaders don't follow the polls, leaders change the polls. ... We have moved so far in advancing entitlement reform, not just in Congress but in this [presidential] race, with most of the candidates embracing comprehensive entitlement reform. ... We should not shy away from this fight, even though we know the Democrats will demagogue us."

(Apparently, in Newt's world, everybody is a radical except Newt.) ... Newt's outburst shows us how the former speaker usually ends up destroying, rather than advancing, thoughtful conservative reforms."

Because it happened in the current campaign, not in the 1990s, it may have more impact."

This model may be politically safer and perhaps more saleable to voters, but it also does little to improve the status quo.
