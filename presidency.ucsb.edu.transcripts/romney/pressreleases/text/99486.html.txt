I am campaigning to restore our great entrepreneurial spirit and I look forward to working with Mike in this endeavor."<p>Announcing his support, former Minority Leader Mike Kopp said, "I am endorsing Mitt Romney for President because I want to see America rise to greatness again. American greatness is not a slogan&mdash;it is what we demand of our country. And it takes steady leadership, aligned with the values of the American people, in the White House to achieve it. While I admire each of the Republican candidates in the race for various reasons, I'm personally committed to working for the one with the strongest record of successful leadership in complex environments: Governor Mitt Romney."<p><b>Background on Former Minority Leader Mike Kopp:</b><p>Minority Leader Kopp served from 2007 to 2011.
