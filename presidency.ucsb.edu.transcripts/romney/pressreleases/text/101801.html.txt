I am honored to have the support of such great Asian Americans, and look forward to working with them to get our country on the right track again."&nbsp;<p>"I am honored&nbsp;that Governor Mitt Romney asked me to serve as the national chair of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Romney," said former Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao.&nbsp;"Having worked in previous&nbsp;presidential administrations, I know Governor Mitt Romney has the experience and the character to tackle the problems that are facing our nation. Americans are suffering, and it will take new leadership to put this country on a path to prosperity and full employment."<p>"I am pleased and honored to serve as a national co-chair for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Romney," said Universal Health Care CEO Akshay Desai. "As a businessman, I know all too well what it takes to make it in the private sector. When I hear President Obama tell small business people that "somebody else" made their success happen, I know that he is not cut out to turn around our economy. Mitt Romney is the change we so desperately need, and I look forward to having him in the White House."<h4><b>National Chair</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Elaine L.
