By cutting taxes across the board and removing burdensome regulations, the Romney plan will jumpstart our economy and help create 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers. After nearly four years of disappointment and decline, middle-class families simply can't afford another four years under President Obama." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Mitt Romney Has A Plan For A Stronger Middle Class That Will Create 12 Million New Jobs And Higher Take-Home Pay:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Mitt Romney Will Pursue Fundamental Tax Reform That Reduces Individual Income Tax Rates By 20% And Cuts The Corporate Tax Rate To 25%. </b>"I will lower taxes to lighten the burden on middle-income Americans and to reignite the economy. A key measure will be an across-the-board, 20% reduction in marginal individual income tax rates. By reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers, we will encourage hard work and productivity by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. ... I will reduce the corporate tax rate to 25%. Currently, it's among the highest in the developed world; I will bring it in line with other nations, making America a place where investment capital flows."
