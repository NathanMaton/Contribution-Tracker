If we get this economy growing like we know we can, we can create 12 million jobs in four years. We're offering solutions. And among those solutions we're offering, our number one, make sure that we use our own energy because we have our own energy in this country. All of it." &mdash; Paul Ryan<p><b>Remarks<br />Lakewood, CO</b><br /><b>August 14, 2012</b><p><b><i>Click <a href="http://youtu.be/U0VqGTWpSXo">Here</a> To Watch Paul Ryan</i></b><p><b>PAUL RYAN: </b>"What Mitt Romney and I are offering, the Romney-Ryan plan for a stronger middle class, is designed to get people back to work. It is designed to create jobs. If we get this economy growing like we know we can, we can create 12 million jobs in four years. We're offering solutions. And among those solutions we're offering, our number one, make sure that we use our own energy because we have our own energy in this country. All of it. You have it all here in Colorado. You know, last week when I was filling my truck up, which something tells me I'm not going to be putting gas in my truck for any time soon, but last week when I was filling my truck up, it cost $100, and the only reason it cost $100 is because the pump cut me off at $100 because of the gas tank. Enough. We have our own oil and gas. We have nuclear. We have all of the above, winds, solar, coal, let's use it. Let's make our energy independence. Let's create jobs. Let's stop sending jobs overseas by buying oil overseas."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
