It also is our national security. This is the first responsibility of our federal government. And one of the critical means and needs for a strong national defense is because the world needs America's leadership. In the past day, Iran's President called our ally Israel 'a cancerous tumor that must be excised.' Let me be really clear. Under President Romney our adversaries will think twice about challenging America and our allies because we believe in peace through strength. There will be no daylight between America and our friends around the world. Strong national defense, peace through strength, strong relationship with our allies."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
