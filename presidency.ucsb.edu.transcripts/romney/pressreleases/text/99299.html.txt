I don't think we can possibly retake the White House if the person who's leading our party is the person who was working for the chief lobbyist of Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac was paying Speaker Gingrich $1.6 million at the same time Freddie Mac was costing the people of Nevada millions upon millions of dollars." &mdash;Governor Mitt Romney<h4><b>On the Campaign Trail, Speaker Gingrich Says He Wants to Help the Housing Market:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Gingrich: "I Want To Continue To Focus On Jobs, Getting The Economy Going Again, And Helping The Housing Situation..."</b> (Fox News' "Fox & Friends," 1/24/12)<h4><b>Yet Gingrich Was Paid at Least $1.6 Million by Freddie Mac's Lobbyists to Aid Their Lobbying Agenda:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>Bloomberg</i>: Gingrich Was Paid Between $1.6 Million And $1.8 Million By Freddie Mac. </b>"Newt Gingrich made between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in consulting fees from two contracts with mortgage company Freddie Mac, according to two people familiar with the arrangement."

Specifically, the Freddie Mac executive who hired Gingrich was not the CEO, nor the VP for operations, or the VP for communications, but Craig Thomas, the VP for Public Policy &mdash; that is, the head of Freddie Mac's lobbying operations. Thomas was a registered lobbyist at the time. ... So, Gingrich may or may not have made lobbying contacts on Freddie's behalf, but it appears he was being paid to aid Freddie Mac's lobbying agenda."
