Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction that cuts spending, keeps taxes low for middle-class families, and saves Medicare for future generations." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>This Weekend, Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter Called President Obama's $700 Billion In Medicare Cuts An Achievement:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Yesterday, A Top Obama Campaign Adviser Lauded "The $700 Billion Cuts In Medicare That The President Achieved" Through Obamacare.</b> CUTTER: "You know I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform."
