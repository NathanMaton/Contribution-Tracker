Unfortunately, with these attacks, it shows that he's just a small politician and running on small ball politics at a time when our country is facing grave, grave challenges. And no ad is going to decide this election, whether the President likes it or not. The economy and jobs are going decide this election, and his record on that is abysmal. We've had over 40 straight months of over 8 percent unemployment, dismal jobs reports, and his policies have been a failure when it comes to turning our economy around."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
