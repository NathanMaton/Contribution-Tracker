   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"While in Congress, Senator Santorum repeatedly joined Democrats in siding with labor unions over American employers and workers. He opposed right-to-work legislation and supported Big Labor's priorities on numerous occasions. Americans concerned about a healthy job market and economic growth will have to ask Senator Santorum if this was just another example of putting principles aside to 'take one for the team.'" &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>In 2012, Big Labor Has Put Its Money On The Line To Support Santorum's Candidacy:</b></h4><p><b>AFSCME Made A Major Ad Buy In Ohio Before This Week's Primary And "Seems To Be Working Hard For A Santorum-Versus-Obama Faceoff in November."</b> "[Santorum] got a major boost Monday in Ohio from the big-money intervention of an unlikely source: one of the country's premier unions. The real endorsement of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) will go to President Obama. But with a half-million-dollar ad purchase aimed at persuading voters in the Ohio Republican primary not to vote for Mitt Romney, disclosed Tuesday, the union seems to be working hard for a Santorum-versus-Obama faceoff in November."

He also said the fast track vote should be considered separately from the NAFTA vote. 'His voting record is his voting record, and it is completely different than what they are saying in this mailing,' Mihalke said." (Nicole Weisensee, "Labor Rating Riles Santorum State Afl-Cio Lied About His Voting Record, He Charges," Philadelphia Daily News, 9/24/94)<p><b>A Santorum Aide Called The AFL-CIO's Low Score "A Lie."</b> "I think they should step forward and make it very clear to their members that this mailing is a ... lie."

This shields unions from competition on federal construction projects. It will also add $10.9 billion to the deficit in 2011. Given that the federal government is already running historic and unsustainable deficits, federal policy should not unnecessarily inflate the cost of federal construction projects. Congress should repeal the DBA."

But so far the Administration has put on the back burner all the proposals that might give labor more power, except for one: a bill that would prohibit management from replacing strikers permanently with newly hired workers. And now that bill has become the defining labor issue of the young Clinton Presidency, as important today as the air traffic controllers strike was in the early Reagan years."
