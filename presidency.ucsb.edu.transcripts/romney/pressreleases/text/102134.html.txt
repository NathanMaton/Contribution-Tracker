   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Sixteen years ago today, President Bill Clinton signed bipartisan welfare reforms, claiming it was 'clearly better to go to work' than to stay on welfare. But don't expect President Obama to mark the occasion after just last month gutting the historic work requirements. The Romney-Ryan Plan will restore work to welfare and jumpstart the economy to create 12 million new jobs for middle-class families." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Sixteen Years Ago Today, President Clinton Signed Welfare Reforms That Ended "Welfare As We Know It":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Clinton, On August 22, 1996: "The New Bill Restores America's Basic Bargain Of Providing Opportunity And Demanding, In Return, Responsibility." </b>CLINTON: "The new bill restores America's basic bargain of providing opportunity and demanding, in return, responsibility. It provides $14 billion for child care, $4 billion more than the present law does. It is good because without the assurance of child care it's all but impossible for a mother with young children to go to work. It requires States to maintain their own spending on welfare reform and gives them powerful performance incentives to place more people on welfare in jobs. It gives States the capacity to create jobs by taking money now used for welfare checks and giving it to employers as subsidies as incentives to hire people." (President Bill Clinton, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1996-book2/pdf/PPP-1996-book2-doc-pg1325.pdf">Remarks</a>, Washington, D.C., 8/22/96) <ul style="margin-left: 80px; "> <li style="margin-left: 40px; ">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6JLCjNG5JY"><b>Click Here To View</b></a></li> </ul> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Clinton: "It Is Now Clearly Better To Go To Work Than To Stay On Welfare&mdash;Clearly Better." </b>CLINTON: "It is now clearly better to go to work than to stay on welfare&mdash;clearly better. Because of actions taken by the Congress in this session, it is clearly better. And what we have to do now is to make that work a reality."&nbsp;(President Bill Clinton, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrGh4mMxHIE">Remarks</a>, Washington, D.C., 8/22/96) <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Clinton Hailed The Legislation As Providing "An Historic Opportunity To End Welfare As We Know It" And Transform Welfare To Promote "The Fundamental Values Of Work." </b>"Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3734, the 'Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.' While far from perfect, this legislation provides an historic opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our broken welfare system by promoting the fundamental values of work, responsibility, and family. This Act honors my basic principles of real welfare reform. It requires work of welfare recipients, limits the time they can stay on welfare, and provides child care and health care to help them make the move from welfare to work." (President Bill Clinton, Statement, 8/22/96) <h4><b>And What Was Barack Obama Saying After President Clinton Signed Welfare Reform? He Claimed He Was "Not A Huge Supporter" Of The Reforms:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>State Senator Barack Obama, In 1998: "The 1996 Legislation I Did Not Entirely Agree With And Probably Would Have Voted Against At The Federal Level." </b>OBAMA: "One of the good things about welfare reform, which the 1996 legislation I did not entirely agree with and probably would have voted against at the federal level."

I was not a huge supporter of the federal plan that was signed in 1996."

If you want to get more people to work, you don't loosen the requirements &mdash; you tighten them. That's why, as critics of the new waivers point out, the work requirement of the 1996 law was 'specifically designed not to be waivable.' The 1996 law allows waivers for certain provisions &mdash; such as state reporting rules &mdash; but the 'mandatory work requirements' contain no waiver provisions. ... The administration is simply ignoring the law."

The president's flouting of the separation of powers risks turning this country into something other than a representative democracy. Congress should move in a bipartisan rebuke of Obama's overreach before he neuters that institution. In a blatant challenge to the legislative branch, Obama by executive order tossed out the Clinton-era welfare reform that required able-bodied aid recipients to work, saying the federal government will no longer enforce the law."

The decline, at a rate of 200,000 a month, is the deepest and most sustained in U.S. history." (John F.
