Whether it's making false promises that his plan will fix the nation's skyrocketing debt or claiming that tax hikes will somehow fix the economy, President Obama is willing to say anything to distract Americans from his abysmal record of failure on the economy." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>President Obama's Evolving Story On His Tax Hike Plan Started By Claiming It Would "Stabilize Our Debt And Deficits":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>In September 2011, President Obama Claimed His Tax Hike Plan Could "Raise Enough Money" To Finance His Spending Priorities And "Stabilize Our Debt And Deficits." </b>OBAMA: "What I've said is this is a very simple principle that everybody should understand: Warren Buffett's secretary shouldn't pay a lower [sic] tax rate than Warren Buffett. ... And that basic principle of fairness, if applied to our tax code, could raise enough money that not only do we pay for our jobs bill, but we also stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade. And as I said when I made the announcement, this is not politics; this is math."

Introducing a minimum 30 percent income tax on millionaires ‘was never our plan to bring the deficit down and get the debt under control,' Jason Furman, the principal deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday afternoon. ‘This is not the president's entire tax plan. We're not trying to say this solves all our economic problems, all our budget problems.'"

That's less than one-tenth of one percent of the $1.2 trillion budget deficit Mr. Obama is scheduled to run this year. Through 2022 Joint Tax expects less than $47 billion in total new revenues from the Buffett rule while the government will be adding trillions of dollars to the national debt."
