   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Four years ago in Orlando, Candidate Obama claimed he had a plan to help the middle class. But, after years of disappointing progress, it's clear middle-class families aren't better off under President Obama: wages are lower, household costs are higher, and the next generation will be forced to pay off a skyrocketing national debt. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction and new pro-growth policies that get all Americans back to work." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>During A 2008 Campaign Speech In Orlando, Candidate Obama Claimed Flat Wages And More Debt Cause "Our Economy As A Whole" To Suffer:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In Orlando Exactly Four Years Ago: "When Wages Are Flat, Prices Are Rising, And More And More Americans Are Mired In Debt, Our Economy As A Whole Suffers." </b>OBAMA: "That's the truth at the heart of your Opportunity Compact - that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street and a struggling Main Street. That when wages are flat, prices are rising, and more and more Americans are mired in debt, our economy as a whole suffers. Our competitiveness as a nation suffers. Our children's future suffers."
