Mitt Romney spent his career helping turn around companies, the Olympics, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At the same time, Congressman/Senator Rick Santorum spent his career in Washington, voting repeatedly to increase the debt ceiling and his own pay. If business as usual in Washington is the problem, Rick Santorum can't be part of the solution." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>1991 &mdash; Congressman/Senator Santorum First Arrived In Congress, While Mitt Romney Led The Turnaround Of Bain & Company:</b></h4><p><b>In 1991, Senator Santorum Spent His First Of Sixteen Years In Congress. </b>"In 1990, Mr. Santorum, then 32, was first elected to the House of Representatives, and four years later rode an anti-incumbent wave into the Senate.

This fiscal discipline continued in 2004, in which Romney continued to slash 'nearly every part of state government' to close a $3 billion deficit."
