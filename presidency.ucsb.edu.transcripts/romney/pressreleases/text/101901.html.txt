Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will focus on common sense solutions to stop Washington from spending money it doesn't have and get the federal government out of the way of small business job creators.&nbsp;<p>"I'm proud to call Paul Ryan a friend, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that he and Mitt Romney - along with our entire Republican ticket - are well positioned to win in November."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
