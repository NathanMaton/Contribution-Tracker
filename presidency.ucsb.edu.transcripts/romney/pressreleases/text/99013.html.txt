Exactly one month before yesterday's vote, Gingrich admitted that he brought discredit to the House and broke its rules by failing to ensure that financing for two projects would not violate federal tax law and by giving the House ethics committee false information."

The committee's 7 to 1 vote came after 5 1/2 hours of televised hearings ... 'This is a tough penalty,' Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.), chairman of the ethics panel, said after the vote. 'I believe it is an appropriate penalty. It demonstrates that nobody is above the rules.'" (John E. Yang and Helen Dewar, "Ethics Panel Supports Reprimand of Gingrich," <i>The Washington Post</i>, 1/18/97)<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>: "The House Imposed The Penalty ... After Gingrich Acknowledged He Gave The Ethics Committee Untrue Information."</b> "The House imposed the penalty last year after Gingrich acknowledged he gave the ethics committee untrue information and failed to ensure that financing for two projects, including a college course he taught, would not violate federal tax laws. The penalty was to reimburse the ethics committee for added costs it attributed to investigating Gingrich's misleading statements." (Bill McAllister, "Gingrich To Pay Penalty With His Own Money," <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/091598.htm"><i>The Washington Post</i></a>, 9/15/98)<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>"Gingrich Confessed ... To Violating The Rules."</b> "Gingrich confessed December 21 to violating the rules, admitting he should have sought specific legal advice about financing his college course and a town hall television project with tax-exempt donations. He took responsibility for inaccurate assertions that GOPAC, his former political organization, had no role in the college course."

The concession was among the most dramatic of any Gingrich representative." (Charles R. Babcock and John E.

And I think in that sense, it actually helps me in getting people to understand - this was a Nancy Pelosi-driven effort." (Fox News' "On The Record," 12/6/11)<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><b>PolitiFact, On Gingrich's Assertion: "Pants On Fire."</b> "While it's true that the Gingrich case became a vicious battlefield between the two parties, contemporary accounts and experts familiar with the proceedings agree that it was not ajudicated by 'a very partisan political committee' in a way that 'related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics.' The ethics panel's case only moved forward with the express consent of Republicans, including the committee's chairwoman, and it was led by a special counsel who was not a Democratic partisan and who focused on substantive legal matters. Most notably, when it became time to vote, the House - including nearly 90 percent of voting Republicans - voted to support the committee's recommendation. We rate Gingrich's statement Pants on Fire."

If he didn't believe in the fairness of the process, he could have refused to admit wrongdoing and taken his chances on the House floor, where he led a sizable majority."

He was also off base when he said the inquiry was 'a Pelosi-driven effort.' In fact, the House Committee on Ethics is the only House panel evenly divided by party. And Pelosi was a relatively junior House member and not in a leadership position at the time. ... The ethics panel was far from a 'partisan' committee."
