And yesterday, Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, quote, 'I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks.' This conduct is contemptible. It betrays our national interest. It compromises our men and women in the field. And it demands a full and prompt investigation, with explanation and consequence. Whoever provided classified information to the media, seeking political advantage for the administration, must be exposed, dismissed, and punished. The time for stonewalling is over." &mdash;Mitt Romney<h4><b>Senator Dianne Feinstein (D) &mdash; Chair Of The Senate Intelligence Committee &mdash; Said Yesterday That The White House Has Been Leaking Classified Information:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Senator Feinstein: "I Think The White House Has To Understand That Some Of This Is Coming From Their Ranks."</b> "A prominent Democrat is giving the White House heartburn over national security leaks.

The leaks have included news that the U.S. has launched cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear program and details of an investigation into an al-Qaeda bombing plot."

I can't say that there weren't leaks. There were obvious leaks, but they weren't from the White House. ... The last thing that [President Obama] would countenance or anybody around him would countenance are leaks that would jeopardize the security of Americans on these secret missions, and the success of those missions. So, you know, I think when he said on Friday that he said offended about it, he was speaking from that place."
