Given the Obama Administration's track record in dealing with rogue regimes, I have many serious concerns about this administration's Iran policy. Obama's approach seems to be based on a complete misreading of the intentions of the ayatollahs. And by wasting precious time, his policies have placed the security of the state of Israel in jeopardy. It's past time for a change in leadership in the White House."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
