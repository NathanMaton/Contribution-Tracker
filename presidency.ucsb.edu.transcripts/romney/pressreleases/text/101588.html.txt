Now editorial boards around the country have weighed in, and they couldn't be more clear, either &mdash; President Obama's comments 'demeaned' and insulted hard-working Americans." &mdash;Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Editorial Boards Across America Agree That President Obama Has Little "Sympathy For The Plight Of The Small Business Person":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>Foster's Daily Democrat</i>: "President Obama Has Little Understanding Let Alone Sympathy For The Plight Of The Small Business Person &mdash; The Singularly Largest Driver Of Jobs In The United States."</b> "These words, delivered a week ago to supporters in Roanoke, Va., have been seen by some as an insult to the small business community &mdash; dismissive of what really goes into making a business successful. Working for a newspaper that has survived through good times as well as bad times over five generations of family ownership, it is hard for the editorial board here at Foster's Sunday Citizen to accept any argument to the contrary. It has been apparent for some time now that President Obama has little understanding let alone sympathy for the plight of the small business person &mdash; the singularly largest driver of jobs in the United States."

The Dominant Role."</b> "It's going to be interesting to see how the president's spinners explain this one away. The comment about somebody else's being responsible for your success, Mr. Business Owner, wasn't taken out of context. Though there was a lot of context in this speech. An awful, boring lot. This president's speeches about the economy aren't measured in minutes but light-years. Listen to this speech and you know exactly how this president feels about the private sector -- and the role government should play in all our lives. The dominant role. (He gave the speech in Roanoke, Va., last Friday."

President Barack Obama told campaign supporters 'if you've got a business &mdash; you didn't build that.' At minimum, his off-the-cuff comment devalues the importance of effort, sacrifice, dedication and hard work. And it's not how it works outside D.C."

The Driver Is The Individual With A Dream And A Passion..." </b>"Obama simply doesn't understand that government is not the source of American prosperity; it is simply a supporting player. The driver is the individual with a dream and a passion, such as Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, who revolutionized personal computing by building the first Apple computer in a garage."

They are not passive recipients of government programs. They are, in fact, the people who pay the bulk of taxes that underwrite such programs, and they expect a return on that investment, not a lecture from a politician about why they need to do even more. They did indeed build something of value. For the president to suggest otherwise is insulting &mdash; and revealing."

That Business Owners Who Risked It All For A Better Life Aren't Responsible For Their Own Prosperity." </b>"Without a record of economic recovery to run on, President Barack Obama is taking a startling gamble this summer. He clearly believes that not only do Americans lack such entrepreneurial dreams, but that business owners who risked it all for a better life aren't responsible for their own prosperity."

Somebody else made that happen.' In Obama's world, your success isn't really your success. The government deserves credit.
