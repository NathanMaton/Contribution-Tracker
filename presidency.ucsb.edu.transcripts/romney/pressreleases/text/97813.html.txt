The burdens now placed on small businesses and working Americans, and those who want to work, seem unbearable. I believe Mitt has emerged as the right person at the right time to lead America. I am honored to serve as his Wyoming Chairman and look forward to bringing his conservative message of fiscal responsibility to voters in my state." <p><b>Background On Congressman Cynthia Lummis:</b> <p>Congressman Lummis was first elected to Congress in 2008 and serves on the Appropriations Committee.
