John Barrasso <p><b>Obama's False Sense Of Fairness</b> <p>Politico<br />Sen. John Barrasso<br />August 27, 2012<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80164.html" target="_blank"><br />http://www.politico.com</a> <p>... <p>President Barack Obama regularly promises in campaign speeches that his policies will give every American a "fair shot." As with his previous campaign promises, the president knows people interpret "fair" to match their own meaning. <p>... <p>For more than three and a half years, the president has governed by his politically motivated idea of fairness. His record demonstrates that "fair" for him doesn't mean equal opportunity for all Americans – it means equal outcome regardless of efforts. <p>We now know that the president thinks it's fair to redefine the work requirements for the welfare program to include bed rest and helping neighbors run errands. <p>He thinks it's fair to tell defense contractors they cannot warn employees about future layoffs before the election &mdash; because he doesn't want workers to know that he supports looming defense cuts. <p>He thinks it's fair to take more than $700 billion from seniors on Medicare to spend on a whole new program for someone else, "Obamacare." <p>He thinks it's fair to tell American seniors that he has strengthened Medicare, though he has no workable plan to prevent it from going bankrupt. <p>He thinks it's fair that his health care law will force many college students to lose access to low-cost health plans they were previously able to get through their schools. <p>... <p>Instead of equal opportunity for everyone, we are left under this president with more debt, fewer jobs and less innovation. <p>... <p>One person getting more does not mean someone else has to get less. <p>... <p>We must restore real fairness in America. We can start by paying off the crushing debt that's been piled on the backs of all Americans. We can begin to dismantle the mountain of bureaucracy that stifles American opportunity. <p>... <p>Give the American people a fair shot for real, and we will win on our own. <p align="center"><i>**In compliance with copyright laws, this version of the editorial is excerpted**</i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
