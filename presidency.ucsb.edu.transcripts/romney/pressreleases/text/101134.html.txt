JINDAL: </b>"Well, two things. One, I think it goes to two themes of this campaign.

We've seen the start of that this week and now you're seeing Mitt Romney respond which I think is a very good thing."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
