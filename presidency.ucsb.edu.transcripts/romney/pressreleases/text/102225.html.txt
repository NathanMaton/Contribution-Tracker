   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"Candidate Obama promised to 'change America' for the middle class by adopting a 'different measure' of progress. But instead of delivering more jobs and higher incomes, President Obama's policies have left the middle class in worse shape than when he took office, with chronic unemployment, skyrocketing gas prices, and poverty on track to hit fifty-year highs. As president, Mitt Romney will actually deliver for the middle class by helping create 12 million new jobs and a more prosperous future for the next generation." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>Four Years Ago, Candidate Obama Claimed He Wanted To "Change America" And Adhere To A "Very Different Measure" Of Progress:</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, At The 2008 Democratic Convention: "It's Time For Us To Change America. ...
