Bobby Jindal</i></b><p><b>GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: </b>"You know Governor Romney's got a lot of policies that would benefit Colorado and our entire country. For example, for Colorado's small business owners, he's made it clear he does not think the right thing to do is to raise their taxes. For our energy industry here in Colorado, he wants to pursue an all of the above strategy which would help, for example natural gas producers and others that are frustrated with the current administration. For Colorado families, he understands the importance of growing the private sector economy. Here in Colorado since President Obama was elected the median family income has gone down nearly $3,000. You got nearly 22,000 fewer people working in the state. Governor Romney understands that we have got to cut taxes. We've got to freeze government regulations. We've got to grow the private sector economy. So I think he's got a very ambitious, aggressive agenda that will be great for the state, great for the country. And here's the most important issue in this election, the single most important issue is getting America back on track. So we simply just cannot afford another trillion dollars a year of debt—of deficit spending—by our federal government. We can't afford—we're now at 42 months of unemployment being above eight percent across the country. We cannot afford another four more years of this President's policies."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
