This shouldn't come as a surprise &mdash; it is exactly what he did as Speaker, handing out earmarks as political favors. It's just more politics as usual and fiscal recklessness from a Washington insider. Expensive and empty promises won't help Nevadans who are suffering under dire economic conditions." &mdash;Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Candidate Gingrich Promised Florida the Moon:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>In Florida, Speaker Gingrich Promised To Establish A Permanent Colony On The Moon &mdash; Playing To The State's Space Coast.</b> "Newt Gingrich told a cheering crowd along Florida's Space Coast late Wednesday that he would establish a permanent colony on the moon, and develop a spacecraft that can get to Mars, by the end of his second term as president. Gingrich, who has long held a fascination with space exploration and has talked extensively about further missions to the moon, Mars and beyond, committed for the first time to pushing aggressively for such programs if he wins the White House."

Bush introduced a space exploration initiative that aimed to establish a base on the moon costs were projected to be about $100 billion through 2020. President Obama, however, canceled the mission in 2010, because it was running behind schedule and was costing too much money. ... John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University and founder of the school's Space Policy Institute ... says a similar mission today could cost somewhere between $250 billion to $500 billion."

That propensity to think big extends to all parts of his presidential platform, from tax reform to the space race, and occasionally puts him at odds with his party's resolve to slash government spending. ... Gingrich has said he would only use 10 percent of NASA's total budget to create prizes and other incentives to spur private-sector space innovation. That would amount to about $1.8 billion a year of taxpayer dollars if the NASA budget remained at its current levels."
