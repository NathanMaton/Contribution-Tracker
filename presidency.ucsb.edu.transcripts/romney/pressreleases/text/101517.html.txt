Now Democrats are threatening to tank our entire economy and harm our national security if they don't get a massive tax increase on small business people. Yesterday, a non-partisan study from Ernst & Young showed that the President's proposed tax hike would cost our economy 700,000 jobs. Why are they pushing this tax [increase]? I think that the President explained that himself yesterday. He doesn't believe that small businesses create jobs, he thinks government creates jobs. Listen, I was a small business guy. I worked hard, I took a hell of a lot of risk and I was successful. And it sure wasn't the government there to help my small business. I am the one that had the sleepless nights. I am the one who went out on a limb to hire people and when I had to meet that payroll, it was my obligation, not only to take care of those people who worked for me, but to take care of those families of those people who worked for me. And I think the President's attack on the private sector in America is exactly what's wrong with this administration. He doesn't give a damn about middle-class Americans who are out there looking for work. What he's trying to do is distract the American people in order to win his own reelection."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
