On the economy and jobs, there is no other candidate with his economic know-how, experience in the private sector, or proven leadership. Nevada has suffered more than any other state under this President and Nevadans are looking for a leader with a plan to grow the economy. Tonight, Mitt Romney presented his plan to put Nevada on a path to prosperity once again."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
