   </div></div><span class="displaytext">"In 2008, Candidate Obama promised Sioux City voters he wouldn't resort to the 'politics of smear and slash and burn' – but that's exactly what they've seen from President Obama. Instead of delivering hope and change, the President has resorted to divisive attacks to distract voters from the problems facing middle-class families. As president, Mitt Romney will bring new leadership to Washington and focus on creating 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson <h4><b>In 2008, Candidate Obama Told Sioux City Voters He Would "Run A Positive Campaign All The Time" And Reject "The Politics Of Smear And Slash And Burn":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, In Sioux City In 2008: "They Said, Well, You Know What He Can't Run A Positive Campaign All The Time, He's Going To Have To Go Negative ... But, You Know What, We Said No." </b>OBAMA: "Then they said, well, you know what he can't run a positive campaign all the time, he's going to have to go negative. When we were down 20 points in the middle of the summer, all the pundits were saying he's going to lose unless he really goes negative. He's got to kneecap the frontrunner, he's got to do a Tanya Harding on her."

Specifically, that was so soooo Barack Obama in 2004, when the little-known state Senator from Illinois made these inspiring comments at the Democratic National Convention. Four years after that, Obama waged his juggernaut of a hope-and-change campaign. Now he heads up a seek-and-destroy effort. That means TV viewers in battleground states like Florida will face a lot more negative messaging from both sides than in 2008."
