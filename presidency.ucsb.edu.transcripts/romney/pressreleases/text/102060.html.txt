After four years of Barack Obama, Americans are not better off – they are ready for new leadership that will grow our economy and strengthen the middle class." –Ryan Williams, Romney Spokesman <h4><b>On "Face The Nation" This Morning, President Obama Stressed The Role Of Government In Helping People "Get Into The Middle Class":</b></h4> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>President Obama: "Government Can Be A Force For Good" When It Comes To Moving People Into The Middle Class. </b>PRESIDENT OBAMA: "And I'm willing to do more on that front because, as I argued at the convention, those of us who believe that government can be a force for good when it comes to creating opportunity for folks who are willing to work hard and play by the rules to get into the middle class, we have an obligation to make sure government works."
