Under the President's plan, men and women who defended our country abroad will face mounting struggles here at home. As president, Mitt Romney will never balance the books on the backs of our nation's veterans." &mdash; Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Under The Obama Administration, Backlogged Disability Claims Have "More Than Quadrupled":</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Veterans' Disability Claims That Have Been Pending For More Than 125 Days Have "More Than Quadrupled" Under President Obama's Watch. </b>"Veterans can be eligible for help with conditions caused or aggravated by their military service. The government, however, has long struggled to keep up with the claims, and the backlog has grown worse during the president's term in office as soldiers return from Iraq and Afghanistan. In May 2009, about 135,000 claims for disability benefits had been pending for more than 125 days, representing about one-third of all pending claims. Today, that number has more than quadrupled, to 558,000 claims - about two-thirds of all those pending."

The cuts would total $12.9 billion over five years. To offset the loss, retirees would pay higher enrollment fees based on how much they earn through their military pensions.

Student veterans from across the country report that the Department of Veterans Affairs simply hasn't paid their tuition yet this semester, or that it just arrived, months late. Promised housing stipends, too, remain unpaid. Veterans are dipping into their savings, facing eviction, and taking out loans to get by. The culprit appears to be simple staffing shortages and bureaucratic sluggishness, but the consequences have been intensely disruptive." (Rosie Gray, "For Thousands Of Veterans, The New G.I.
