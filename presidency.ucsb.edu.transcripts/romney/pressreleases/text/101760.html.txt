Instead of hope and change, he's running a campaign based on anger and divisiveness that won't create jobs or fix the economy. Americans deserve better than a president who's just another Washington politician." &mdash; Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson<h4><b>Candidate Obama Promised To "Walk The Walk" On Condemning Outside Groups &mdash; But He's Fundraised For And Avoided Criticizing The Obama Super PAC:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Candidate Obama, On His Opposition To Outside Political Groups: "You Can't Just Talk The Talk. ...

And the individual who's running the group used to be John Edward's campaign manager. You can't say yesterday, you don't believe in 'em, and today, you're having three-quarters of a million dollars being spent for you. You can't just talk the talk. The easiest thing is to talk about change during an election time. Everybody talks about change in an election time. ... My track record is strong on this. I walk the walk."
