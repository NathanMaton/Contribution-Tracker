"Since I started my campaign, I've looked to share my vision of how to create jobs and once again restore fiscal sanity in Washington. This show of support from leaders in the Tarheel State proves that my message is resonating."<p>Announcing his support, State Senator Tommy Tucker said, "North Carolinians are sick and tired of Washington's reckless spending. Mitt Romney spent his life as a conservative businessman. He knows that, in the real economy, you simply cannot keep spending more than you take in. As president, he will cut federal spending and push for a balanced budget amendment. We cannot risk another four years of Barack Obama's failed policies. I call on all conservatives that want a simpler, smaller, and smarter federal government to join me in supporting Mitt Romney."<p><b>North Carolina Elected Officials and Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>State Senator Tommy Tucker<br />Former Associate Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court Robert Orr<br />Representative Bill Current<br />Representative Tim Moore<br />Representative Danny McComas<br />Representative Jimmy Dixon<br />Representative Pat McElraft<br />Former Mayor of Charlotte and Gubernatorial Candidate Richard Vinroot<br />Former Charlotte Mayoral Candidate Scott Stone<br />Former Wake County Commissioner Kenn Garnder<p><b>North Carolina Elected Officials Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:</b><p>US Senator Richard Burr<br />Former US Senator Elizabeth Dole<br />Congressman Howard Coble<br />Congresswoman Virginia Foxx<br />Congressman Patrick McHenry</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
