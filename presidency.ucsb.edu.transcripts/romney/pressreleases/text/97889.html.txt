   </div></div><span class="displaytext">Mitt Romney today announced the endorsement of Texas Congressman Lamar Smith. <p>"I am proud to have Congressman Smith's support," said Mitt Romney. "On issues that I have focused on such as border security and job creation, Lamar has been at the forefront in the Congress. I look forward to working closely with Lamar both during my campaign and in the effort to fix our struggling economy." <p>Congressman Lamar Smith said, "Like many Americans, I believe the United States urgently needs to replace Barack Obama as president with a proven leader who will create jobs, reduce the nation's debt and embrace traditional values. The Republican Party is fortunate to have many candidates who are well-qualified to do just that. Last May– three months before Governor Rick Perry announced his candidacy – I committed to supporting Mitt Romney. I support Mitt Romney because I believe that he has the specific skillset needed to turn around the economy: he has a conservative track record as a successful businessman and as a governor who created jobs, cut taxes, and kept spending low." <p><b>Background On Congressman Lamar Smith:</b> <p>Congressman Lamar Smith represents the 21<sup>st</sup> District in Texas. In the U.S. House, Smith serves as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Prior to his election to Congress, Smith was a member of the Texas House of Representatives. He also was a practicing lawyer and rancher.</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
