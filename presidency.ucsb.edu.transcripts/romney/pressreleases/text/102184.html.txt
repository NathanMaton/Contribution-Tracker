Now, given Barack Obama's steady distancing of the U.S. from one of our most important allies, Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital has been excised from the Democrats' platform.&nbsp;In light of the Obama Administration's policies toward the Jewish state, the shifts in the Democratic Party platform regarding Israel should not come as a complete surprise. Just last week, the Obama campaign stated that the Democratic Party platform 'will represent where the President is and where he wants to take the country.' If that is true, I call upon all friends of Israel to condemn the President's abrupt break with our closest ally in the Middle East."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
