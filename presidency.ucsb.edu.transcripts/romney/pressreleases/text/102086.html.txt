The President frequently talks about the need for education reform which will give every child the skills they need to be successful in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and a chance at the American Dream.

We need a president who will stand up for the students of Chicago and across the country. Mitt Romney will not put politics over principle. He will lead."</span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><span class="displaynotes"><i></i></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
