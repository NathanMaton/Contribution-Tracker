Aside from being career politicians who embraced earmarks and voted to raise their own pay, both stayed in D.C. after leaving office and worked in the lobbying community. Mitt Romney offers something different. He is not a creature of Washington. He offers the kind of private sector and chief executive experience that career politicians can't match." &mdash;Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman<h4><b>Speaker Gingrich And Congressman/Senator Santorum Worked As "Consultants" For D.C.-Based Lobbying Shops:</b></h4><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Gingrich Was Paid As A "Consultant" To Support Freddie Mac's Lobbying Operation. </b>"[Gingrich's] Freddie Mac work gives off a whiff of lobbying, according to the contract he just released.

Thomas was a registered lobbyist at the time." (Timothy P.
